        Bourbon Madrid
        West of Puerta del Sol is the city’s 18th-century expansion
        engineered by the Bourbon monarchs. Calle de Alcalá merges with Gran
        Vía and leads to the Plaza de la Cibeles and the Paseo del Prado,with
        its trio of art museums. The area’s spacious boulevards, grand plazas,
        and fountains are interspersed with densely populated 18th-century
        apartment buildings. After hitting the art world’s Big Three, visitors
        can repair to Retiro Park, where kings once found respite from the
        demands of hectic city life.
        Except for the traffic spitting out noise and air
        pollution, the ample Plaza de la Cibeles is splendid. The central
        fountain depicts Cybele, a controversial Greek fertility goddess,
        serenely settled in a chariot pulled by two lions. The sculptural
        ensemble is probably the best-known fountain in all Spain. The most
        unavoidable building on the plaza is the cathedral-like Palacio de
        Comunicaciones, teasingly nicknamed Nuestra Señora de las
        Comunicaciones (Our Lady of Communications). Inaugurated in 1919, the
        building is the quite remarkable central post office, with high
        ceilings and overhead walkways.
        Also facing Plaza de la Cibeles, the Banco de España (Bank
        of Spain) headquarters combines Neo-classical, Baroque, and rococo
        styles. The financial district, Madrid’s Wall Street, begins here on
        calle de Alcalá. Imposing buildings in this high-rent district contain
        the head offices or branches of more than 100 banks, plus insurance
        companies, the finance ministry, and on nearby Plaza de la Lealtad, the
        Bolsa de Comercio (Stock E xchange). Heading down leafy Paseo del Prado
        you’ll find the first, and greatest, of the art museums here.
