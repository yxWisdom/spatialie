19-Apr-2012 -- Because the weather was fine and we still had some time, we drove to this point after the visit of 46N 25E.

The route didn't take an end, and the streets often were very bad. In contrast the villages and the landscape were very impressing. The last three km of the way went on a very small road, rather a bad field path, passing a newly built monastry to the buildings near the crossing. We only had to go 200 metres across a humid meadow until the edge of the field.

We drove on a bigger road to Sibiu, in German: Hermannstadt, a nice little town with pleasant flair.
