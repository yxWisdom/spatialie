Ventura to Los Angeles â€“ 1 day, 73 miles
Wednesday, November 16th, 2005
  
   For a day in Ventura, in addition to visiting schools, I watched surfers, sat at the beach for sunset, and visited Patagonia. I stopped by the headquarters of environmental friendly and profitable Patagonia, which generates a large portion of their electricity from photovoltaic cells over their parking lot. I also met three cyclists riding south from Vancouver with their own environmental web log.

 
   After staying at the house of a teacher at Cabrillo middle school, I left at dawn to try to avoid the Santa Ana winds. Passing a navy base, I followed the Pacific Coast Highway along the coastal mountains, passing through Malibu and Santa Monica before turning towards West Los Angeles where I met my friend Julia Goodnough.
