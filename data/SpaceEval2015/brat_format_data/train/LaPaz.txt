South into Argentina
Monday, December 11th, 2006

   I spent a week in La Paz, where I talked to almost the entire American School. I also somehow managed to get in two major newspapers, three radio stations, and a morning live interview on national television (the program â€˜Al Despertar,â€™ for those of you who tune into Bolivian television…) 
 
 

   From La Paz, I basically started biking south as fast as I could, and I am now in Northern Argentina. I have been traveling fast for a few reasons â€“ the end of the school year (southern hemisphere summer) means I canâ€™t give presentations, I have a desire to not be rushed later in the trip, and I made a promise to meet a friend who is flying in to bike with me.

  
   The terrain has been breathtaking. I crossed the worldâ€™s largest salt flat, and biked across the Atacama Desert, crossing sections of the desert by moonlight. There were few services on these roads – at one point had to carry 30lbs of food and water. Click on the images below to visit the photo albums of the past few weeks.

Southern Bolivia, including the worldâ€™s largest salt flat (biked partially with Wouter):


The Atacama Desert of Chile, including some incredible night biking:


Northern Argentina, where I am now. I caught up with Brooks and Gregg (and another cyclist Tom). Remember Gregg and Brooks? I biked across sections of Mexico with them, and just ran into them again:
