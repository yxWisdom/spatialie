23-Jul-2002 -- 47°N 26°E is located in the Ceahlău mountains near the village Izvoru Alb.

In the 3rd day of our trekking-tour through Ceahlău we visited the confluence at 16:12 o'clock. Only thick forest, nothing to see, only trees. It wasn`t very easy to get there with our big rucksacks on the back.
