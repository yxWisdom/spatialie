05-Oct-2001 -- The confluence is located between the villages of Fizeşu Gherlii and Sântioana some 500 meters from the road on a small hill. At first it seemd quite easy to reach the point from the road, but after 100 meters we discovered a small river hidden by trees and of course no bridge.

After 30 minutes we found a road that crossed the river, but which did not lead to the confluence. We were now at almost 1.5 km from the confluence and had to find a way to get closer again. We managed to find a very bad road, full of tractor trails and went by car till we were aproximately 800 m away from the point. After that it was a short, but steep walk uphill.
