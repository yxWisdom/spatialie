23-Mar-2002 -- On March 23rd, a rainy and cloudy weather, the team (Mara Iliescu, Dana Iliescu, Ramona Demean, Marius Iliescu, Mihai Tiepac and Lucky) drove from Sibiu to Deva. Reaching Simeria we've done right till Uroi. We passed through Hărău and Certeju de Jos arriving in the village Hondol. Along the valley Hondol at the right side we found an abandoned mine and at only 50 meters we parked the car. The GPS 'said' that from here till the point we had 200 meters left (Point). Our trip continued on foot crossing the valley and climbing the hill which was covered by a young and dense forest. When we reached the point it started snowing. Altitude 575 meters. Distance from Simeria 17.1 km.
