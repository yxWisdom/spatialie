02-Jan-2010 -- On the way back from our winter sports holiday the Confluence Point 48N 10E was situated only a few kilometres away from the autobahn A96 resp. A7. Such an opportunity should be taken.

The GPS routed us through the village ‘Rot an der Rot’. In a very friendly atmosphere we saw an affectionately restored monastery building. Furthermore the trip lead us into the village of Spindelwag. Woodwork seems to play an important role here.

On the one hand I never saw more palettes on a heap before. On the other hand a big wooden hull was produced over the street. After about 1,000 meters we reached the confluence point on a court from a homestead.

In these late hours I didn't wanted to disturb anybody, so I did my short confluence dance without the approval of the owners. Apart from the noises of the live stock in the stable I couldn't hear anything or see anybody. Despite the darkness the needed pictures turned out quite well. The GPS reception was very good and stable in spite of the buildings around.
