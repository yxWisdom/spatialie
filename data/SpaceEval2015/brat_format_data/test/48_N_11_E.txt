22-Mar-2008 -- On our easter holiday trip to Munich I convinced the family to visit this beautiful confluence. After having left the highway, it´s only a short trip through Augsburg and some smaller villages to come to this point.

We drove some small roads along nice Bavarian meadows and stopped about 500 m away from the confluence. From here we had a wonderful view on the Alps while dancing towards the desired zeros.

After taking our pictures we continued our trip to Munich and the Bavarian Alps where we went skiing for one perfect day.
