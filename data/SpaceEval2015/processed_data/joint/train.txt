1	I talked with two climate modellers at INPA , Francis and Theotonio ( shown on the right with their â€˜supercomputerâ€™ ) , about how this deforestation would affect the rainforest , as cutting down a forest changes evaporation and thus rain patterns .

0	If the entire forest were cut down , they estimate that rainfall would decrease on average 30 % , with many areas becoming too dry for forest .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0	Indeed , one study suggests that there are two stable states of the Amazon â € “ one state like the rainforest we find today , and another state where much of the forest is dry savannah .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PLACE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

0	These studies , however , do not consider the effects of global warming .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
0	To be sure , the effects of global warming are uncertain because large scale climate models are not good at modelling rainfall in the tropics .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
