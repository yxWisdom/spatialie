Daniel B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
start O
with O
our O
Enduros B-MOTION
approx O
. O
100 O
kilometers O
from O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
. O

In O
the O
preceding O
years O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
travelled B-MOTION
some O
thousand O
offroad O
kilometers O
in O
Romania B-PLACE
and O
therefore O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
take B-MOTION
the O
most O
beautiful O
Enduro O
paths B-PATH
to O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
, O
naturally O
there O
is O
also O
something O
new O
to O
discover O
. O

The O
last O
kilometers O
before O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
take B-MOTION
the O
forest O
road B-PATH
, O
which O
leads B-MOTION
approximately O
toward O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
are O
driving B-MOTION
on O
the O
street B-PATH
, O
because O
it B-PATH
goes B-MOTION
steeply O
uphill O
from O
the O
valley B-PLACE
and O
is O
is O
rather O
hard O
to O
drive B-MOTION
in O
the O
forest B-PLACE
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
drove B-MOTION
through O
this O
road O
section B-PATH
already O
several O
times O
, O
conscious O
that O
it B-PATH
is O
very O
near O
to B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
confluence O
point O
N B-PLACE
45° I-PLACE
E I-PLACE
22° I-PLACE
( O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
August O
1999 O
) O
, O
however O
without O
knowing O
of O
the O
" O
Degree O
Confluence O
Project O
" O
- O
my O
friend O
Ulrich O
Leardi O
told O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
it O
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
bend B-MOTION
off O
on O
the O
forest O
road B-PATH
, O
which O
is O
partly O
freshly O
graded O
. O

In B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
top B-PLACE
there O
are O
even O
completely O
new O
branches B-PATH
toward B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
to O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
because O
of O
the O
present O
timber O
work O
! O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
try O
to O
drive B-MOTION
near O
on O
the O
wood-cutting O
tracks B-PATH
as O
close O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
after O
approx O
. O

2 O
hours O
of O
travel B-MOTION
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
got B-MOTION
the O
motorcycles B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
within O
530 O
meters O
of O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
cross B-MOTION
a O
light O
hardwood O
forest B-PLACE
and O
a O
deeply O
cut O
brook O
bed B-PATH
. O

In O
our O
maps O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
would O
have O
to O
lie B-NONMOTION_EVENT
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
clearing B-PLACE
. O

At B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
top B-PLACE
the O
forest B-PLACE
becomes O
lighter O
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
goe B-MOTION
toward O
it B-PLACE
and O
discover B-MOTION
a O
clearing B-PLACE
, O
grown O
mainly O
with O
large O
ferns B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
is O
however O
still O
approx O
. O
. O
100 O
meters O
further O
southwest B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
dive B-MOTION
again O
into O
the O
hardwood O
forest B-PLACE
and O
cross B-MOTION
a O
further O
, O
deeply O
cut O
brook O
bed B-PATH
. O

The O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
is O
now O
a O
few O
steps O
from O
here B-PLACE
, O
and O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
move B-MOTION
in O
a O
zigzag O
through O
the O
forest B-PLACE
, O
the O
arrow B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
GPS B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
jumping B-MOTION
again O
and O
again O
around O
. O

After O
several O
attempts O
, O
however O
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
always O
land B-MOTION
in O
the O
same O
place B-PLACE
: O
Here B-PLACE
is O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
! O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
take O
a O
few O
pictures O
, O
unfortunately O
without O
the O
hoped-for O
view O
and O
take O
a O
small O
rest O
. O

Then O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
take B-MOTION
the O
way B-PATH
back O
through O
the O
wonderful O
landscape B-PLACE
, O
having O
afterwards O
a O
very O
interesting O
Enduro B-MOTION
week O
with O
many O
beautiful O
Offroad O
kilometers O
. O

Romania B-PLACE
has O
very O
much O
nature O
to O
offer O
, O
the O
hospitality O
of O
the O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
terrific O
- O
this O
country B-PLACE
is O
always O
worth O
a O
journey O
! O

15-Aug-2003 O
-- O
On O
15-August-2003 O
our O
journey B-MOTION
to O
three O
confluence-points B-PLACE
led B-MOTION
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
on O
the O
E B-PATH
70 I-PATH
from O
the O
point B-PLACE
south B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
of I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Craiova B-PLACE
to O
Strehaia B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
took B-MOTION
the O
road B-PATH
to O
Targu B-PLACE
Jiu I-PLACE
. O

The O
roads O
are O
in O
really O
good O
condition O
. O

According O
to O
many O
boards B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
beside B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
streets B-PATH
this O
is O
the O
result O
of O
a O
co-operation O
with O
the O
European O
Union O
. O

In B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
village B-PLACE
Ciuperceni B-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
took B-MOTION
the O
direction B-PATH
to O
Godinesti B-PLACE
and O
followed O
finally O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
followed B-MOTION
the O
sign B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
Paraul B-PLACE
de I-PLACE
Vale I-PLACE
. O

The O
way B-PATH
through B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
village B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
accompanied B-NONMOTION_EVENT
by O
children B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
geese B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
chickens B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
cows B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
sheep B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
etc. O
had O
the O
correct O
direction O
. O

But O
soon O
the O
tar O
cover O
ended O
and O
it O
was O
more O
and O
more O
difficult O
to O
drive B-MOTION
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
continued O
driving B-MOTION
, O
because O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
too O
hot O
to O
walk B-MOTION
the O
last O
3000 O
m O
. O

Finally O
our O
Mitsubishi O
stuck O
and O
we O
had O
much O
trouble O
to O
make O
it O
free O
again O
. O

So O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
to O
park B-MOTION
the O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
about O
700 O
m O
far B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
from I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
N45E23 B-PLACE
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
edge B-PATH
of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
forest B-PLACE
. O

But O
now O
we O
were O
lucky O
. O

It O
was O
rather O
hilly O
, O
nevertheless O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
forehilles B-PATH
of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Southern B-PATH
Carpates I-PATH
, O
but O
the O
forest B-PLACE
was O
not O
hard O
to O
cross B-MOTION
and O
its O
shade O
was O
refreshing O
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
found B-MOTION
N45E23 B-PLACE
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
clearing B-PLACE
with O
view O
on O
grass-covered O
hills B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

Horses B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
feasted B-NONMOTION_EVENT
nearby O
and O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
enjoyed O
the O
beautiful O
prospect O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
shade B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
shrubs O
– O
after O
having O
taken O
the O
photos O
, O
of O
course O
. O

After O
the O
very O
careful O
return O
trip B-MOTION
down O
to O
Paraul B-PLACE
de I-PLACE
Vale I-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
turned B-MOTION
via O
Godinesti B-PLACE
to O
Baia B-PLACE
de I-PLACE
Arama I-PLACE
and O
Baile B-PLACE
Herculane I-PLACE
. O

This O
travel B-MOTION
gave O
wonderful O
views O
into O
the O
Carpates B-PATH
. O

Beautiful O
waterfalls O
, O
ravines O
, O
rocks O
, O
wild O
brooks O
and O
passport O
heights O
could O
be O
seen O
and O
we O
ended O
this O
wonderful O
day O
with O
two O
successfully O
visited O
confluences B-PLACE
and O
the O
impressions O
of O
two O
completely O
different O
landscapes B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Caransebes B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
started B-MOTION
home O
to O
Tuttlingen B-PLACE
( O
Germany B-PLACE
) O
the O
next O
day O
. O

23-Aug-2002 O
-- O
On O
23-August-2002 O
at O
8 O
am O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
left B-MOTION
Makó B-PLACE
( O
Hungary B-PLACE
) O
. O

After O
crossing B-MOTION
the O
border B-PATH
to O
Romania B-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
took B-MOTION
the O
road B-PATH
to O
Arad B-PLACE
and O
reached B-MOTION
the O
village B-PLACE
Pecica B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
wanted O
to O
turn B-MOTION
right O
in O
order O
to O
come B-MOTION
to O
Sînpetru B-PLACE
German I-PLACE
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
difficulties O
to O
find B-MOTION
the O
road B-PATH
, O
but O
a O
friendly O
old O
women B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
went B-MOTION
beside O
our O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
until O
the O
edge B-PATH
of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
river B-PATH
Maros B-PATH
, O
which O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
to O
cross B-MOTION
. O

To O
our O
surprise O
there O
was O
no O
bridge O
, O
but O
an O
old O
wooden O
ferry O
( O
better O
to O
say O
: O
a O
float O
) O
. O

It O
really O
was O
an O
adventure O
. O

Using O
field O
tracks B-PATH
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
needed O
plenty O
of O
time O
to O
reach B-MOTION
the O
village B-PLACE
of O
Sînpetru B-PLACE
German I-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
met B-NONMOTION_EVENT
several O
very O
friendly O
women B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
who O
told O
us O
some O
interesting O
historical O
facts O
of O
their O
village O
. O

On O
the O
way B-PATH
to B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Gelu B-PLACE
, O
the O
next O
village B-PLACE
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
to O
drive B-MOTION
over O
meadows B-PLACE
and O
fields B-PLACE
but O
fortunately O
there O
were O
some O
farmers O
we O
could O
ask O
for O
the O
right O
way B-PATH
, O
which O
was O
even O
harder O
to O
drive B-MOTION
than O
the O
ways B-PATH
before O
. O

Finally O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
reached B-MOTION
the O
street B-PATH
from O
Gelu B-PLACE
to O
Sînnicolau B-PLACE
Mare I-PLACE
. O

After O
about O
2 O
km O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
turned B-MOTION
left O
on O
a O
field O
track B-PATH
along B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
high O
corn O
field B-PLACE
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
left O
our O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
46 B-PATH
N I-PATH
, O
150 O
m O
away B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
from I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
point B-PLACE
. O

Carefully O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
followed B-MOTION
the O
GPS O
and O
wanted O
to O
take O
the O
photos O
. O

But O
the O
batteries O
of O
the O
camera O
were O
to O
low O
and O
we O
had O
to O
change B-NONMOTION_EVENT
it O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
field B-PLACE
. O

Interrupting O
that O
action O
, O
an O
unexpected O
farmer O
called O
loudly O
in O
our O
direction O
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
to O
drive B-MOTION
away O
our O
car O
immediately O
. O

After O
his O
tractor B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
passed B-MOTION
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
wanted O
to O
return B-MOTION
to O
the O
point B-PLACE
, O
but O
a O
" O
man O
with O
bike O
" O
tried O
to O
prevent O
us O
from O
doing O
so O
. O

Our O
explanations O
were O
unsuccessful O
, O
so O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
, O
until O
he O
was O
out O
of O
sight O
. O

Now O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
returned B-MOTION
to O
the O
point B-PLACE
, O
took B-NONMOTION_EVENT
the O
photos O
and O
headed B-MOTION
on O
to O

E. O

23-Aug-2002 O
-- O
Leaving B-MOTION
46N B-PLACE
21E I-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
drove B-MOTION
via O
Arad B-PLACE
and O
Lipova B-PLACE
to O
the O
village B-PLACE
Zăbalţ B-PLACE
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
little O
pig B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
tried O
to O
follow B-MOTION
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

About O
5 O
km O
behind B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
that O
village B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
direction I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
to I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Bata B-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
turned B-MOTION
right O
near O
21 B-PATH
E I-PATH
into O
a O
way B-PATH
leading B-MOTION
into O
a O
forest B-PLACE
. O

But O
soon O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
stopped B-MOTION
by O
a O
bar B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

So O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
to O
walk B-MOTION
the O
rest B-PATH
of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
way B-PATH
, O
accompanied O
by O
thousands O
of O
mosquitoes B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

1.3 O
km O
far B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
from I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
confluence B-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
must O
leave B-MOTION
the O
way B-PATH
turning O
left O
, O
because O
it O
was O
the O
wrong O
direction O
. O

The O
walk B-MOTION
through O
thicket B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
wood B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
stinging O
nettles B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
sometimes O
interrupted O
by O
small O
clearings B-PLACE
was O
an O
hard O
effort O
, O
but O
the O
mosquitoes O
did O
n't O
allow O
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
stop B-MOTION
for O
a O
moment O
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
reached B-MOTION
the O
point B-PLACE
after O
about O
half O
an O
hour O
. O

When O
we O
tried O
to O
take O
the O
photos O
a O
big O
hornet B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
joined B-MOTION
to O
the O
mosquitoes B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

So O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend B-NONMOTION_EVENT
some O
more O
time O
there B-PLACE
. O

The O
GPS B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
led B-MOTION
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
back O
to O
the O
way B-PATH
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
our O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
standing B-NONMOTION_EVENT
and O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
happy O
, O
having O
been O
the O
first O
visitors B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
two O

at O
one O
day O
. O

But O
a O
3,5 O
hour O

the O
Romanian/Hungarian O

The O

the O

In O

the O

The O

The O
sun O
was O
shining O
and O
the O
snow O
was O
crunching O
in O
the O

Perfect O
time O
for O
the O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
drove B-MOTION
to O
the O
NE O
on O
the O
11 B-PATH
main I-PATH
road I-PATH
and O
turned B-MOTION
NW O
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Cernat B-PLACE
( O
Csernáton B-PLACE

. O

From O
this O
point B-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
to O
drive B-MOTION
through O
the O
village B-PLACE
and O
than O
towards O
North O
on O
a O
narrow O
mountain O
road B-PATH
, O
where O
the O
horse-sleigh O
is O
so O
far O
the O
most O
popular O
winter O
vehicle O
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
parked B-MOTION
the O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
small O
field B-PLACE
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
could O
turn B-MOTION
. O

This B-PLACE
was O
only O
250 O
meters O
from O
the O
confluence B-PLACE
! O

After O
a O
short O
discussion O
and O
a O
few O
cups O
of O
hot O
tea O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
walked B-MOTION
towards O
the O
target B-PLACE
that O
seemed O
to O
be O
located O
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
hill B-PLACE
. O

This O
area O
is O
a O
valley B-PATH
of O
a O
small O
creek B-PATH
. O

After O
a O
short O
tracking B-MOTION
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
realized O
that O
there O
was O
no O
path B-PATH
up B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
to B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
peak B-PLACE
except O
for O
some O
animal O
trails B-PATH
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
chose O
the O
shortest O
way B-PATH
to B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
top B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
deep O
snow B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

After O
about O
one O
hundred O
meters O
of O
elevation O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
got B-MOTION
to O
the O
top B-PLACE
of O
the O
saddle B-PLACE
, O
very O
close O
to O
the O
intersection B-PLACE
of O
46°N B-PATH

26°E B-PATH
. O

The O
confluence B-PLACE
lies B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
middle B-PLACE
of O
the O
forest B-PLACE
. O

Fortunately O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
good O
satellite O
signal O
because O
of O
the O
winter O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
have O
an O
old O
Garmin O
but O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
got O
an O
accurate O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
took O

to O
the O

There O
was O
only O
1 O
PM O
( O
local O

so O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
some O
time O
left O
to O
discover B-MOTION
an O
interesting O
ruin B-PLACE
of O
Ikavár B-PLACE
( O
Ika B-PLACE

a O
30m O

According O
to O
a O
legend O
, O
the O
Ika B-PLACE
castle I-PLACE
was O
built O
by O
giants O
. O

There O
was O
a O
dragon O
snake O
that O
was O
so O
huge O
that O
it O
could O
drink O
from O
the O
creek B-PATH
while O
coiling B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
up I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
its O
tail B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
the O

. O

According O
to O
the O
Székely O

, O
the O
castle B-PLACE
was O
built O
by O
Ika O

a O
nice O

of O
Urziceni B-PLACE

Ramnicu B-PLACE
Sarat I-PLACE
and O
, O
after O
three O
hours O
of O
driving B-MOTION
and O
200 O
km O
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
reached B-MOTION
Focsani B-PLACE

at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
35 O
km O
from O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
, O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
county B-PLACE

Vrancea B-PLACE
We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
continued O
our O
journey B-MOTION
, O
heading B-MOTION
west O
, O
towards O
Panciu B-PLACE

Passing B-MOTION
through O
the O
villages B-PLACE
of O
Muncelu B-PLACE
and O
Straoane B-PLACE
, O
the O
distance O
to O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
decreased O
to O
almost O
5 O
km O
. O

The O
closest O
area B-PATH
of O
the O
road B-PATH
to B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
confluence B-PLACE
( O
4.8 O
km O

is O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O

of O
the O
Ecaterina B-PLACE
Teodoroiu I-PLACE
monument I-PLACE
( O
Romanian O
female O
hero O
of O
the O
First O

. O

Because O
a O
dirtroad B-PATH
started B-MOTION
right O
at O
the O
monument B-PLACE
( O
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
right I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
coming B-MOTION
from O
Panciu B-PLACE

and O
seemed O
to O
head B-MOTION
exactly O
towards O
the O
target O
point B-PLACE
( O
direction O
North-North-West O
) O
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
left B-MOTION
the O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
continued O
our O
trip B-MOTION
on O
foot O
on O
the O
Dealu B-PLACE
Mare I-PLACE

. O

Luckily O
, O
this O
cart O
road B-PATH
kept O
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
on O
the O
right O
heading O
, O
passing B-MOTION
through O
the O
villagers O
' O
pastures B-PLACE
, O
cornfields B-PLACE
and O
vineyards B-PLACE
. O

After O
about O
3 O
km O
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
entered B-MOTION
the O
forest B-PLACE
, O
and O
at O
a O
crossroad B-PLACE
( O
1 O
km O
from O
the O
confluence B-PLACE
) O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
took B-MOTION
the O
road B-PATH
which O
kept O
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
going B-MOTION
towards O
North-East O
. O

As O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
walked B-MOTION
into O
the O
oak O
wood B-PLACE
the O
road B-PATH
changed O
into O
a O
path B-PATH
, O
which O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
left B-MOTION
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
about O
300 O
m O
from O
the O
confluence B-PLACE
because O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
getting B-MOTION
away O
from O
it B-PLACE
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
surprised O
to O
meet B-MOTION
a O
deer B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
which O
wandered B-MOTION
away O
quickly O
as O
it B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
saw O
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
started O
descending B-MOTION
a O
slope B-PATH
towards O
North-East-East O
and O
, O
after O
an O
hour O
of O
walking B-MOTION
- O
from O
the O
monument B-PLACE
- O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
reached B-MOTION
our O
target B-PLACE
, O
deep O
into B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
forest B-PLACE
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
that O
, O
because O
of O
the O
treetop O
cover O
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
poor O
satellite O
coverage O
, O
but O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
managed O
to O
locate B-MOTION
the O
confluence B-PLACE
with O
a O
10-15 O
m O
error O
, O
after O
some O
wandering B-MOTION
around O

It B-PLACE
lays B-NONMOTION_EVENT

a O
15 O

on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
bottom B-PATH
of O
which O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
saw O
a O
dry O
riverbed B-PATH
. O

The O
steep O
slope B-PATH
and O
the O
thick O
carpet B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
fallen O
leaves O
hindered O
the O
descent B-MOTION
and O
very O
precise O
determination O
of O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE

but O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
managed O
to O
pinpoint B-NONMOTION_EVENT
and O
take B-NONMOTION_EVENT
photos O
within O
sufficient O
accuracy O
from O
' O
zero B-PLACE

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
congratulated O
ourselves O
and O
made O
the O
necessary O
photos O
to O
immortalize O
for O
eternity O
our O
conquest O
. O

The O
return O
journey B-MOTION
was O
easy O
, O
because O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
knew O
already O
the O
area B-PLACE
. O

By O
nightfall O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
back O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Bucharest B-PLACE

In B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
this O

fierce O

around O
1.5 O

the O

The O

English O
On O
our O
way B-PATH
home B-PLACE
from O
Oradea B-PLACE
( O
see O
N47E22 O

we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
made O
a O
detour B-MOTION
for O
N47E23 B-PLACE
. O

In B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Ciucea B-PLACE
, O
after O
visiting B-MOTION
the O
Goga B-PLACE
memorial I-PLACE
house I-PLACE
( O
a O
poet O
and O
former O

from O
the O
beginning O

the O
20th O
century O
– O
worthy O
of O
a O
visit B-MOTION
, O
takes O
less O
than O
an O
hour O
) O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
exited B-MOTION
Road1/E60 B-PATH
and O
turned B-MOTION
left O
to O
Romanasi B-PLACE
. O

The O
road B-PATH
was O
crossing B-MOTION
the O
small O
mountains B-PLACE
of O
Salaj B-PLACE
County I-PLACE
, O
a O
region B-PLACE
with B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
lots O
of O
mountains B-PLACE
and O
hills B-PLACE
, O
lying B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
northern O
part B-PLACE
of O
the O
Western B-PATH
Carpathians I-PATH
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
mountains O
lose B-NONMOTION_EVENT
height O
and O
become B-NONMOTION_EVENT
hills O
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
crossed B-MOTION
many O
villages B-PLACE
, O
but O
the O
confluence B-PLACE
approached B-MOTION
by O
a O
very O
small O
rate O
: O
while O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
driving B-MOTION
one O
kilometer O
the O
confluence B-PLACE
approached B-MOTION
by O
half O
a O
kilometer O
. O

At O
some O
point O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
thought O
that O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
taken B-MOTION
perhaps O
not O
the O
best O
road B-PATH
to O
get B-MOTION
near O
the O
spot B-PLACE
. O

But O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
decided O
to O
keep O
driving B-MOTION
, O
and O
after O
some O
20 O
km O
from O
Ciucea B-PLACE
, O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
village B-PLACE
of O
Bogdana B-PLACE
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
turned B-MOTION
right O
, O
just O
near O
the O
main O
village O
church B-PLACE
. O

The O
confluence B-PLACE
seemed O
to O
be O
over B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
hill B-PLACE
. O

So O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
drove B-MOTION
along O
a O
small O
river B-PATH
that O
took B-MOTION
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
just O
by O
that O
hill B-PLACE
. O

After O
exiting B-MOTION
Bogdana B-PLACE
the O
road B-PATH
is O
so O
bad O
that O
an O
off-road O
vehicle O
is O
a O
must O
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
drove B-MOTION
for O
another O
2 O
or O
3 O
km O
when O
the O
GPS O
showed O
the O
confluence B-PLACE
directly O
up B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
hill B-PLACE
, O
500 O
m O
further B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
left B-MOTION
the O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
under B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
some O
trees B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
for O
shade O
, O
and O
started O
climbing B-MOTION

The O
climb B-MOTION
was O
a O
pleasure O
: O

the O

No O

Just O
the O

All O

from O
Bogdana B-PLACE

the O

the O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
reached B-MOTION
the O

in O
about O
10 O

The O

Getting B-MOTION
back O
to O
the O
paved O
road B-PATH
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
decided O
not O
to O
go B-MOTION
back O
to O
Ciucea B-PLACE
but O
to O
go B-MOTION
on O
to O
Romanasi B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
met B-MOTION
Road B-PATH
1F/E81 I-PATH

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
only O
70 O
more O
km O
to O
Cluj B-PLACE
( O
the O
next O
important O
city B-PLACE
on O
our O
way B-PATH
back O
to O
Bucharest B-PLACE
) O
taking B-MOTION
this O
way B-PATH
, O
while O
if O
getting B-MOTION
back O
to O
Ciucea B-PLACE
and O
on O
to O
Cluj B-PLACE
the O
normal O
way B-PATH
would O
have O
been O
now O
about O
25 O
km O
longer O
. O

So O
it O
was O
a O
pretty O
long O
detour B-MOTION
but O
worthy O
, O
as O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
mapped O
the O
13th O
Romanian O
confluence B-PLACE
. O

05-Oct-2001 O
-- O
The O
confluence B-PLACE
is O
located B-NONMOTION_EVENT
between B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
villages B-PLACE
of O
Fizeşu B-PLACE
Gherlii I-PLACE
and O
Sântioana B-PLACE
some O
500 O
meters O
from O
the O
road B-PATH
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
small O
hill B-PLACE
. O

At O
first O
it O
seemd O
quite O
easy O
to O
reach B-MOTION
the O
point B-PLACE
from O
the O
road B-PATH
, O
but O
after O
100 O
meters O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
discovered B-NONMOTION_EVENT
a O
small O
river B-PATH
hidden O
by O
trees O
and O
of O
course O
no O
bridge O
. O

After O
30 O
minutes O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
found O
a O
road B-PATH
that O
crossed B-MOTION
the O
river B-PATH
, O
but O
which O
did O
not O
lead B-MOTION
to O
the O
confluence B-PLACE
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
now O
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
almost O
1.5 O
km O
from O
the O
confluence B-PLACE
and O
had O
to O
find O
a O
way B-PATH
to O
get B-MOTION
closer O
again O
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
managed O
to O
find O
a O
very O
bad O
road B-PATH
, O
full B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
of I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
tractor O
trails B-PATH
and O
went B-MOTION
by O
car O
till O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
aproximately O
800 O
m O
away B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
from O
the O

it O

Well O
a O
new O
job O
and O
a O
new O
country B-PLACE
– O
or O
place B-PLACE
anyway O
– O
Kosovo B-PLACE
has O
an O
uncertain O
international O
status O
. O

Also O
an O
uncertain O
power O
supply O
as O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
write O
this O
by O
candle O
light O
. O

Last O
Friday O
a O
colleague O
asked O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
if O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
going B-MOTION
away O
for O
the O
weekend O
– O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
said O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
not O
planned O
anything O
– O
but O
it O
set O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
thinking O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
quickly O
resolved O
to O
have O
a O
go B-MOTION
at O
the O
nearest O
incomplete O
point B-PLACE
to O
Kosovo B-PLACE
– O
570 O
km O
as O
the O
crow O
flies O
– O
850 O
by O
via-Michelin O
– O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Romania B-PLACE
. O

Fortunately O
Eastern B-PLACE
Europe I-PLACE
– O
even O
outside B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
EU B-PLACE
is O
easy O
travelling B-MOTION
for O
EU O
citizens B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
able O
to O
jump B-MOTION
in O
the O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
( O
after O
printing O
some O
multimaps O
and O
a O
visit O
report O
or O
two O
( O
always O
the O
optimist O
) O
and O
drive B-MOTION
across O
Serbia B-PLACE
, O
and O
Bulgaria B-PLACE
to O
Romania B-PLACE
with O
few O
hassles O
( O
those O
there O
were O
concentrated O
on O
car O
insurance O
) O
. O

Leaving B-MOTION
at O
3.30 O
pm O
on O
Friday O
afternoon O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
covered B-MOTION
500 O
km O
on O
Fri O
eve O
and O
then O
after O
sleeping B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
arrived B-MOTION
near O
the O
confluence B-PLACE
at O
around O
noon O
. O

The O
instructions O
from O
the O
previous O
visitors O
were O
quite O
correct O
and O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
find B-MOTION
the O
suggested O
start O
point B-PLACE
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O
go B-MOTION
a O
little O
further O
up O
the O
valley B-PATH
and O
came B-MOTION
across O
an O
explosives O
depot B-PLACE
– O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
suppose O
It B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
would O
not O
have O
been O
made O
welcome O
here B-PLACE
a O
few O
years O
ago O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
my O
UK O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
! O

As O
previously O
described O
the O
track O
gives O
up O
after O
a O
while O
and O
then O
there O
is O
no O
alternative O
but O
to O
follow B-MOTION
the O
valley B-PATH
up O
. O

The O
dry O
river O
valley B-PATH
was O
no O
longer O
dry O
– O
heavy O
recent O
rains B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Romania B-PLACE
have O
caused O
floods B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
several O
areas B-PLACE
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
tried O
to O
avoid O
walking B-MOTION
in O
the O
stream B-PATH
but O
the O
choice O
was O
tall O
nettles O
and O
brambles O
. O

It O
soon O
became O
clear O
that O
this O
point B-PLACE
was O
not O
going O
to O
be O
taken B-MOTION
easily O
and O
maybe O
the O
first O
visitors B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
made O
a O
wise O
choice O
not O
going B-MOTION
up O
. O

Adam O
Macer O
suggested O
a O
machete O
- O
good O
idea O
. O

The O
valley B-PATH
is O
deep O
with B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
steep O
sides B-PATH
and O
my O
GPS O
would O
only O
pick O
up O
3 O
satellites B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
– O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
nice O
straight O
line B-PATH
and O
it O
would O
not O
give O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
a O
fix O
. O

After O
a O
while O
there O
was O
a O
clearing B-PLACE
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
east O
side B-PATH
of O
the O
valley B-PATH
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
decided O
to O
go B-MOTION
up O
here B-PLACE
. O

It O
was O
very O
hard O
going B-MOTION
– O
steep O
and O
overgrown O
. O

At O
least O
it O
allowed O
the O
GPS O
to O
pick O
up O
more O
satellites O
and O
confirm O
my O
position O
. O

After O
a O
further O
30 O
minutes O
of O
climbing B-MOTION
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
eventually O
reached B-MOTION
the O
point B-PLACE
. O

2 O
hours O
for O
1.8km O
and O
500 O
metres O
ascent B-MOTION
is O
slow O
going O
! O

There O
was O
no O
need O
to O
go B-MOTION
out O
of O
the O
main O
valley B-PATH
and O
the O
point B-PLACE
was O
some O
distance O
from O
the O
ridge O
line B-PATH
- O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O
not O
go B-MOTION
on O
up O
to O
the O
ridge B-PATH
to O
see O
the O
rain O
from O
a O
different O
angle O
! O

The O
start B-PLACE
altitude O
was O
550 O
metres O
and O
the O
estimated O
height O
for O
the O
point B-PLACE
on O
the O
web O
site O
was O
875 O
metres O
. O

In O
fact O
the O
point B-PLACE
was O
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
1020 O
metres O
– O
so O
a O
climb B-MOTION
of O
almost O
500 O
metres O
. O

The O
return B-MOTION
– O
as O
always O
– O
was O
much O
quicker O
; O
one O
hour O
only O
to O
the O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stayed B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
deep O
forest B-PLACE
as O
much O
as O
possible O
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
way B-PATH
to O
the O
valley O
bottom B-PLACE
– O
slithering B-MOTION
and O
sliding B-MOTION
down O
the O
deep O
leaf O
litter B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

Once O
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
stream B-PATH
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
abandoned O
all O
pretence O
at O
dry O
feet O
and O
splashed B-MOTION
merrily O
down O
the O
stream B-PATH
– O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
rain B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
soaked O
and O
had O
very O
scratched O
and O
stung O
arms O
and O
legs O
but O
satisfied O
with O
the O
point B-PLACE
– O
stupid O
is O
n’t O
it O
! O

Near O
the O
bottom B-PLACE
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
saw O
a O
black O
and O
yellow O
salamander B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
trying O
to O
squeeze B-MOTION
itself B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
under O
a O
stone B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

The O
next O
visitor O
is O
welcome O
to O
my O
watch B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
– O
it B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
came B-MOTION
off O
somewhere B-PLACE
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
way B-PATH
down O
– O
if O
you B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
go B-MOTION
at O
7.30 O
am O
maybe O
you B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
will O
find O
it B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
by O
hearing O
the O
alarm O
go O
off O
. O

Anyway O
only O
a O
cheap O
Casio B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
! O

After O
the O
point B-PLACE
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
went B-MOTION
to O
Sighişoara B-PLACE
– O
home B-PLACE
of O
Dracula O
with B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
fine O
medieval O
citadel B-PLACE
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O
n’t O
stay B-NONMOTION_EVENT
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Dracula B-PLACE
hotel I-PLACE
or O
eat B-NONMOTION_EVENT
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Dracula B-PLACE
café I-PLACE
but O
slept O
and O
ate O
very O
well O
despite O
the O
thunderstorm O
. O

No O
time O
for O
more O
points B-PLACE
this O
time O
– O
there O
are O
two B-PLACE
unvisited O
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Moldavian B-PATH
border I-PATH
and O
one B-PLACE
more O
incomplete O
near O
the O
Danube B-PLACE
delta I-PLACE
. O

Another O
time O
. O

That O
reminds O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
– O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
have O
not O
seen O
the O
points B-PLACE
of O
Molvania B-PLACE
“ O
a O

on O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
hope O
this O
strange O
omission O
will O
be O
rectified O
so O
that O
point O
baggers O
there O
can O
report O

their O

Only O
thick O

nothing O

21-Aug-2005 O

Continued O
from O
45N O
29E O
- O
The O
second O
point B-PLACE
is O
further O
north B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
– O
away B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
from I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Danube B-PLACE
delta I-PLACE
and O
very O
close O
to O
the O
Moldovan B-PATH
border I-PATH
. O

The O
worry O
with O
this O
point B-PLACE
was O
whether O
there O
is O
any O
restricted O
zone B-PATH
along B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
border B-PATH
which O
would O
prevent O
a O
visit B-MOTION
. O

Driving B-MOTION
away O
from O
Tulcea B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
crossed B-MOTION
the O
Danube B-PATH
for O
the O
3rd O
of O
4 O
times O
in O
2 O
days O
. O

This O
time O
it O
was O
a O
ferry O
. O

Very O
prompt O
and O
well O
organised O
. O

Soon O
after O
disembarking B-MOTION
and O
heading B-MOTION
north O
for O
Galaţi B-PLACE
it O
started O
to O
rain O
. O

This O
area B-PLACE
suffered O
from O
severe O
floods B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in O
July O
and O
there O
is O
still O
water O
lying B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O

and O
gardens B-PLACE
and O
dead O
crops B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
remain O
, O
forlorn O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
fields B-PLACE
. O

The O
rain O
became O
torrential O
and O
it O
was O
only O
just O
possible O
to O
keep O
driving B-MOTION
for O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
. O

Eventually O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
got B-MOTION
away O
from O
it B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
quite O
soon O
was O
driving B-MOTION
on O
dry O
roads B-PATH
again O
. O

Galaţi B-PLACE
is O
not O
an O
attractive O
place B-PLACE
– O
ugly O
apartment O

chemical O

It O
is O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

glad O
to O
be O
away B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL

Moving B-MOTION
further O
north O
you B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
pass B-MOTION
through O
rich O
farmland B-PLACE
and O
then O
rolling O
hills B-PATH
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
decided O
to O
camp B-NONMOTION_EVENT
as O
close O
to O
the O
point B-PLACE
as O
possible O
so O
that O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
could O
make O
an O
early O
start O
and O
drive B-MOTION
home B-PLACE
on O
the O
Sunday O
. O

As O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
drove B-MOTION
through O
the O
villages B-PLACE
there O
were O
many O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
walking B-MOTION
to O
the O
nearest O
village B-PLACE
for O
the O
Saturday O
night O
dance B-NONMOTION_EVENT
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
camped B-NONMOTION_EVENT
near O
the O
hamlet B-PLACE
of O
Sălăgeni B-PLACE
– O
just O
a O
few O
metres O
from O
the O

. O

No O
sign O
of O
the O

or O
any O

. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
woken O
up O
by O
the O
sun O
at O
dawn O
– O
6.30 O
a.m. O

There O
were O
already O
old O
men B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
taking B-MOTION
cattle B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
out O
to O
the O

The O
scene O
reminded O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
the O
German O

. O

The O

traces O
a O

through O
80 O
years O

. O

Sălăgeni B-PLACE
reminded O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
the O
first O
episode O
set O
in O
about O
1918 O
– O
tranquil O
but O
with O
few O

. O

Horses O
are O
more O
common O
than O
cars O
and O
ducks B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
hens B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O

wander B-MOTION
around O
. O

The O
point B-PLACE
itself O
was O
1 O
km O
from O
the O
village B-PLACE
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
forded B-MOTION
two O
drainage O
ditches B-PATH
– O
one B-PATH
waist O
high O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
am O
sure O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
could O
have O
gone B-MOTION
round O
but O
why O
not O
go B-MOTION
direct O
! O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
expected O
the O
point B-PLACE
to O
be O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
reeds B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
swamps B-PLACE
but O
the O
valley O
is O
all O
arable O
and O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
walk B-MOTION
to O
the O
point B-PLACE
. O

Romania B-PLACE
is O
now O
complete O
! O

On B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
way B-PATH
back O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
chatted B-NONMOTION_EVENT
to O
an O
elderly O
man B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
– O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
no O
common O
vocabulary O
but O
got O
on O
fine O
! O

No O
time O
for O
messing O
about O
– O
long O
drive B-MOTION
home B-PLACE
so O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
changed O
and O
set B-MOTION
off I-MOTION
. O

Some O
random O
observations O
– O
You O
might O
think O
Romania B-PLACE
was O
already O
a O
member O
of O
the O
EU O
from O
the O

– O
It B-PLACE
soon O
will O
be O
in O
the O
EU O
but O
it B-PLACE
is O
very O
different O
from O
Western B-PLACE
Europe I-PLACE
– O
To O
the O
“ O

, O
not O
so O
in O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

in O

to O
giving B-NONMOTION_EVENT
a O

for O
INPA B-PLACE
and O
also O
for O
students B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
neighboring B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
University B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked B-NONMOTION_EVENT
with O
scientists O
modelling O
climate B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Amazon B-PLACE
rainforest I-PLACE
. O

From O
what O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
gather O
, O
the O
rainforest B-PLACE
faces O
three O
major O
threats O
. O

1 O
) O
Direct O
deforestation O
, O
2 O
) O
Decreased O
rainfall O
caused O
by O
deforestation O
, O
and O
3 O
) O
the O
possibility O
that O
global O
warming O
will O
dry O
out O
the O
basin B-PLACE
. O

Although O
the O
Amazon B-PLACE
basin I-PLACE
is O
enormous O
( O
similar O
in O
size O
to O
the O
contiguous B-PLACE
U.S. I-PLACE
) O
, O
deforestation B-NONMOTION_EVENT
is O
a O
major O
threat O
. O

Everywhere B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
roads B-PATH
are O
built B-MOTION
, O
the O
forest B-PLACE
is O
cut B-MOTION
down O
, O
making O
way O
for O
fields B-PLACE
of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
soy O
beans B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
or O
beef O
cattle B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

From O
one O
of O
the O
researchers O
at O
INPA B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
received O
the O
images O
below O
which O
show O
the O
forest B-PLACE
in O
1992 O
, O
deforestation O
by O
2002 O
, O
and O
then O
projected O
deforestation O
in O
2033 O
( O
deforestation O
shown O
in O
red O
) O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked B-NONMOTION_EVENT
with O
two O
climate O
modellers O
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
INPA B-PLACE
, O
Francis O
and O
Theotonio O
( O
shown O
on O
the O
right O
with O
their O
â€˜supercomputerâ€™ O
) O
, O
about O
how O
this O
deforestation O
would O
affect O
the O
rainforest B-PLACE
, O
as O
cutting O
down O
a O
forest O
changes O
evaporation O
and O
thus O
rain O
patterns O
. O

If O
the O
entire O
forest O
were O
cut O
down O
, O
they O
estimate O
that O
rainfall O
would O
decrease O
on O
average O
30 O
% O
, O
with O
many O
areas O
becoming O
too O
dry O
for O
forest O
. O

Indeed O
, O
one O
study O
suggests O
that O
there O
are O
two O
stable O
states O
of O
the O
Amazon B-PLACE
â O
€ O
“ O
one O
state O
like O
the O
rainforest O
we O
find O
today O
, O
and O
another O
state O
where O
much O
of O
the O
forest O
is O
dry O
savannah O
. O

If O
too O
much O
forest O
is O
cut O
down O
, O
there O
is O
a O
possibility O
that O
it O
would O
push O
much O
of O
the O
Amazon B-PLACE
into O
the O
drier O
state O
, O
unable O
to O
easily O
return O
to O
forest O
. O

( O
More O
on O
this O
here O
. O
) O

These O
studies O
, O
however O
, O
do O
not O
consider O
the O
effects O
of O
global O
warming O
. O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
the O
effects O
of O
global O
warming O
are O
uncertain O
because O
large O
scale O
climate O
models O
are O
not O
good O
at O
modelling O
rainfall O
in O
the O
tropics O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
a O
few O
models O
( O
not O
all O
) O
suggest O
that O
a O
warmer O
earth O
means O
a O
much O
drier O
Amazon B-PLACE
, O
which O
would O
turn O
much O
of O
the O
basin B-PLACE
into O
savannah O
. O

This O
may O
be O
wrong O
. O

It O
may O
also O
be O
correct O
. O

Decreasing O
rain O
and O
savannahization O
are O
real O
risks O
to O
the O
rainforest B-PLACE
. O

Due O
to O
uncertainty O
in O
the O
science–we O
ca O
nâ€™t O
be O
sure O
if O
deforestation O
or O
global O
warming O
will O
reduce O
rain–it O
is O
difficult O
to O
put O
percentages O
on O
these O
risks O
, O
and O
Theotonio O
and O
Francis O
, O
while O
claiming O
it O
a O
real O
possibility O
, O
balked O
at O
guessing O
its O
probability O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
if O
it O
is O
true O
, O
the O
results O
are O
very O
bad O
. O

A O
loss O
of O
the O
Amazon B-PLACE
would O
not O
only O
loose O
countless O
species O
, O
but O
also O
release B-MOTION
incredible O
amounts O
of O
carbon B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
dioxide I-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
the O
atmosphere B-PLACE
, O
accelerating O
global O
warming O
. O

Do O
we O
really O
want O
to O
find O
out O
if O
it O
is O
true O
or O
not O
? O

My O
last O
full O
day O
in O
Manaus B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
travelled B-MOTION

In B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL

Alex O
maintains B-NONMOTION_EVENT
a O

is O
he O
trying O
to O
understand O
how O

Alex O
let O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
climb B-MOTION
to O
the O
top B-PLACE
of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O

, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
able O
to O
look B-NONMOTION_EVENT
across O
the O

of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O

stretches B-MOTION

Listening O
to O
the O
birds O

, O
it O
was O
hard O
not O
to O
be O
both O
awed O
by O
the O
Amazon B-PLACE

to O
wonder O
what O
its O
future O
will O
be O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

has O
made O
the O

So O
much O
agriculture O

so O
many O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

rely O
on O
this O

So O
much O

the O

, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
biked B-MOTION
over O
120 O

, O
stayed B-NONMOTION_EVENT
with O
three O
different O
people/families O
, O
managed O
to O
get O
in O
two O

visited B-MOTION
a O
school B-PLACE
( O

flooded O
my O

about O

) O
. O

In O
comparison O
to O
Los B-PLACE
Angeles I-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
felt O
safer O
biking B-MOTION
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Mexico B-PLACE
City I-PLACE
as O
the O
cars B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
are O
smaller O
, O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
travel B-MOTION
slower O
, O
and O
there O
are O
far O
more O
small O
alternative O
routes B-PATH
. O

Entering B-MOTION
the O
city B-PLACE
during O
rush O
hour O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
found O
I O
was O
the O
fastest O
vehicle B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
road B-PATH
, O
happily O
following B-MOTION
the O
makeshift O
â€˜bike O
laneâ€™ B-PATH
that O
appeared O
between B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
rows B-PATH
of O
cars B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stopped B-NONMOTION_EVENT
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
traffic O
light B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

It O
was O
a O
sweet O
type O
of O
revenge O
, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
enjoyed O
, O
perhaps O
too O
much O
, O
weaving B-MOTION
in O
and O
around O
the O
multiple O
green O
buses B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
taxis B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
was O
exhausting O
. O

A O
map O
big O
enough O
to O
cover O
the O
city B-PLACE
required O
a O
200-page O
book O
, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
frequently O
stopped O
to O
extract O
it O
from O
my O
pannier O
in O
attempts O
to O
find O
alternate O
routes O
. O

The O
pollution O
stung O
my O
lungs O
and O
eyes O
the O
first O
day O
, O
but O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
seemed O
to O
adapt O
afterwards O
. O

Joining O
forces O
with O
the O
local O
bike O
activists O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
rode B-MOTION
Wednesday O
night O
with O
the O
Bicitekas B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
a O
group O
advocating O
expanded O
bike O
rights O
within O
the O
city O
. O

Starting O
at O
9:30PM O
, O
a O
team B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
almost O
100 O
cyclists O
took B-MOTION
over I-MOTION
two O
lanes B-PATH
of O
traffic O
and O
rode B-MOTION
through O
the O
city B-PLACE
until O
1AM O
. O

Watch O
the O
two O
videos O
on O
the O
left O
to O
get O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
ride O
. O

The O
following O
day O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
visited B-MOTION
a O
sustainable-transportation O
organization B-PLACE
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
one O
of O
the O
cyclists O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
met O
works B-NONMOTION_EVENT
, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
watched O
a O
presentation O
on O
potential O
future O
bike O
lanes B-PATH
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
city B-PLACE
. O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
some O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
do O
use B-MOTION
bicycles O
in O
the O
city B-PLACE
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
have O
a O
running O
survey O
going O
. O

When O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
pass B-MOTION
a O
cyclist B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
ask O
them B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
why O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
ride B-MOTION
, O
and O
why O
there O
are O
nâ€™t O
more O
cyclists B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
roads B-PATH
, O
and O
if O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
have O
been O
in O
an O
accident O
. O

Most O
say O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
ride B-MOTION
because O
it O
is O
faster O
for O
short O
distances O
, O
and O
that O
others B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
do O
nâ€™t O
ride B-MOTION
because O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
are O
scared O
, O
do O
nâ€™t O
think O
of O
it O
, O
or O
are O
just O
plain O
lazy O
. O

Most O
also O
say O
they O
have O
gotten O
in O
some O
type O
of O
accident O
with O
a O
car O
. O

Other O
people O
, O
like O
one O
man B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
biking B-MOTION
and O
carrying O
a O
ladder O
, O
replied O
, O
â€˜ca O
nâ€™t O
you O
see O
I O
â€™m O
trying O
to O
work O
right O
now?â€™ O
and O
kept O
cycling B-MOTION
. O

While O
biking B-MOTION
around O
town B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O
meet B-MOTION
one O
man B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
promoting O
a O
naked O
bike O
ride O
in O
June O
. O

I O
â€™m O
not O
sure O
how O
this O
will O
help O
the O
cause O
. O

Bicycles O
are O
not O
for O
everyone O
, O
but O
they O
are O
for O
more O
people O
than O
currently O
use O
them O
. O

We O
are O
supposed O
to O
get O
some O
form O
of O
exercise O
every O
day O
. O

What O
if O
we O
used O
this O
exercise O
for O
part O
of O
our O
daily O
errand O
running O
? O

Biking O
to O
town O
or O
walking O
to O
the O
store O
? O

Not O
only O
would O
we O
use O
far O
less O
gasoline O
, O
but O
we O
would O
be O
healthier O
, O
and O
we O
would O
actually O
have O
more O
time O
, O
as O
we O
would O
be O
combining O
exercise O
and O
commuting O
. O

Americans O
are O
far O
overweight O
, O
and O
Mexicans O
are O
following O
us O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
ask O
you O
this O
: O
support O
bicycle O
lanes B-PATH
and O
other O
bike-friendly O
infrastructure B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
your O
town B-PLACE
, O
even O
if O
you O
plan O
not O
to O
use O
it O
. O

( O
You O
can O
read O
a O
scientific O
paper O
showing O
how O
much O
better O
off O
we O
would O
be O
here O
) O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
also O
visited B-MOTION
the O
National B-PLACE
Institute I-PLACE
of I-PLACE
Ecology I-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked B-NONMOTION_EVENT
to O
those O
working O
with O
the O
government O
to O
account O
for O
Mexico O
’s O
greenhouse O
gas O
emissions O
. O

Mexico B-PLACE
, O
unlike O
the O
U.S. B-PLACE
, O
has O
signed O
the O
Kyoto O
Protocal O
, O
but O
does O
not O
yet O
have O
to O
reduce O
emissions O
because O
it O
is O
a O
poorer O
country O
. O

At B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
institute B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
met B-MOTION
with O
a O
woman B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
who O
is O
in O
charge O
of O
categorizing O
the O
‘ O
co-benefits O
’ O
of O
reduced O
use O
of O
fossil O
fuels O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
there O
are O
many O
benefits O
other O
than O
a O
better O
climate O
from O
reducing O
our O
use O
of O
fossil O
fuels O
. O

The O
health O
benefits O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
listed O
above O
are O
one O
co-benefit O
. O

Another O
is O
the O
ability O
to O
improve O
the O
horrible O
air-quality O
in O
Mexico B-PLACE
City I-PLACE
. O

And O
the O
political O
benefits O
of O
not O
needing O
oil O
are O
also O
great O
( O
I O
’ll O
talk O
about O
that O
in O
Venezuela B-PLACE
) O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
spent B-NONMOTION_EVENT
my O
last O
three O
days O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
city B-PLACE
as O
a O
tourist O
. O

Mexico B-PLACE
City I-PLACE
was O
built B-NONMOTION_EVENT
by O
the O
Spaniards O
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
top I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
of O
a O
seasonal O
lake B-PLACE
and O
the O
ruins B-PLACE
of O
the O
Aztec O
civilization O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
visited B-MOTION
the O
ruins B-PLACE
of O
the O
former O
Aztec O
temple B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
walked B-MOTION
through O
the O
anthropology O
museum B-PLACE
, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
visited B-MOTION
the O
pyramids B-PLACE
of O
Teotihuacan B-PLACE
( O
photo O
on O
right O
) O
. O

Now O
the O
descendents B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
these O
civilizations O
walk B-MOTION
the O
streets B-PATH
here B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Mexico B-PLACE
City I-PLACE
, O
mixed O
with O
the O
descendents O
of O
the O
Spanish O
conquerors O
. O

There O
is O
something O
strange O
about O
a O
massive O
city B-PLACE
that O
has O
entirely O
covered B-MOTION
both O
a O
natural O
lake B-PLACE
and O
a O
former O
civilization B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

The O
reporter O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stayed O
with O
the O
last O
three O
nights O
claimed O
that O
this O
gave O
the O
city B-PLACE
a O
unique O
energy O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
finally O
left B-MOTION
Mexico B-PLACE
City I-PLACE
, O
departing B-MOTION
on O
a O
road B-PATH
that O
cuts B-MOTION
between O
two O
18,000 O
ft O
volcanoes B-PLACE
( O
named O
Popocatepetl B-PLACE
and O
Iztacihuatl B-PLACE
) O
. O

Almost O
500 O
years O
earlier O
, O
Hernan B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
Cortez I-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
the O
Spanish O
conquistador O
, O
traveled B-MOTION
over O
this O
pass B-PATH
with O
a O
small O
army B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
invaded B-MOTION
the O
Aztec O
capital B-PLACE
. O

Now O
the O
pass B-PATH
is O
a O
nice O
place B-PLACE
to O
bicycle B-MOTION

26th O

2006 O
After O
a O
week O
in O
Bogota B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
departed B-MOTION
the O
city B-PLACE
, O
leaving B-MOTION
behind B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
what O
almost O
seems O
routine O
at O
this O
point O
– O
a O
group B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
new O
friends O
, O
a O
newspaper O
appearance O
, O
and O
a O
city B-PLACE
that O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
hope O
to O
return B-MOTION
to O
someday O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
escorted B-MOTION
out O
of O
town B-PLACE
by O
Bruce B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
an O
American O
who O
helped B-NONMOTION_EVENT
me O
out O
while O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Bogota B-PLACE
. O

Heading B-MOTION
northwest O
towards O
Venezuela B-PLACE
( O
map O

, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
first O
stopped B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
colonial O
town B-PLACE
of O
Zipaquira B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
locals O
have O
converted B-NONMOTION_EVENT
a O
salt O
mine B-PLACE
into O
an O
underground O
cathedral B-PLACE
. O

Continuing O
on O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
told O
by O
everyone O
that O
this O
stretch O
of O
road O
was O
safe O
, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
proceeded B-NONMOTION_EVENT
to O
camp B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
countryside B-PLACE
next B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
to I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
families B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

My O
first O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

clay B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
out O

his O

then O
forms O
the O
clay O
into O
bricks O
, O
and O
then O
cooks O
the O
bricks O
with O
coal O
to O
harden O
them O
. O

The O

of O

are O
made O
out O

apparently O
this B-PLACE

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
helped O
cut B-MOTION
some O
clay B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
( O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

more O
a O

Camping B-NONMOTION_EVENT

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

inevitably O
asked O
about O

about O
what O
life B-NONMOTION_EVENT
is O
like O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
U.S. B-PLACE

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
try O
to O
explain O
that O
there O
is O
a O
difference O
between O
standard O
of O
living O

quality O
of O
life O
, O
and O
that O
while O
you O
make O
more O
money O
in O
the O

things O
are O
also O
more O
expensive O
( O
just O

what O

. O

But O
, O
while O
most O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
see O
seem O
to O
have O
good O
family O

community O
lives O
, O
the O
health O

is O
poor O

they O
have O
nowhere O

the O

my O

is O
proving O
to O
be O
difficult O

Nearly O
17 O
months O
ago O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
biked B-MOTION
out O
my O
front O
door B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
California B-PLACE
and O
started O
biking B-MOTION
south O

Just O
a O
few O
days O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
arrived B-MOTION
at O
the O
end B-PLACE

as O

South B-PLACE
America I-PLACE
. O

Much O
happened O
in O
these O
17 O
months O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
now O
have O
personal O
connections O
with O
so O
many O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
across B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
two O
continents B-PLACE
â O
€ O
“ O
people O
whose O
houses B-PLACE
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stayed B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
or O
camped B-NONMOTION_EVENT
next B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
to I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
now O
speak O
very O
good O
Spanish O
, O
some O
Portuguese O

a O
few O

in O
the O
native O
language O
of O
Quechua O
( O
useful O
in O
the O

. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
have O
taken B-MOTION
a O
boat O
up O
the O
Amazon B-PATH
, O
crossed B-MOTION
dirt O
roads B-PATH
over O
15,000 O

luckily O
escaped B-NONMOTION_EVENT

felt O
the O

dodged B-MOTION
buses B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O

nearly O
every O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
believe O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
able O
to O
experience O
all O
of O
this O
, O
and O
looking O
through O
my O
pictures O
and O
journals O
is O
an O
emotional O
experience O
. O

Global O
warming O
is O
a O
problem O
that O
has O
no O
borders O
and O
will O
affect O
all O
of O
us O
, O
and O
to O
solve O
it O
will O
require O
all O
of O
us O
to O
work O
together O

It O
will O
cause O
water O
problems O

deadly O
storms O
, O
agricultural O
losses O

rising B-MOTION

and O
major O
extinctions B-NONMOTION_EVENT
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
land B-PLACE
and O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
oceans B-PLACE
. O

We O
simply O
do O
not O
want O
a O
planet O
with O
these O
problems O
â O
€ O
“ O
why O
should O
we O
tolerate O
these O
results O
? O

In O
terms O
of O
getting O
the O
word O
out O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
far O
more O
success O
than O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
expected O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
visited B-MOTION
over O
60 O
schools B-PLACE
, O
giving B-NONMOTION_EVENT
talks B-NONMOTION_EVENT
to O
thousands O
of O
students O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
appeared O
in O
the O
national O

in O
nearly O
every O
country O
â O
€ O
“ O
whether O
television O

Thousands O
have O
followed O
my O
journey O
on O
this O

This O
success O
combined O
with O
the O
generosity O
of O
all O
the O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
met B-MOTION
along B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
road B-PATH
leaves O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
feeling O
optimistic O
about O
what O
is O
possible O
. O

In O
a O
few O
days O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
will O
return B-MOTION
to O
the O
United B-PLACE
States I-PLACE
, O
where O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
am O
sure O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
will O
be O
shocked O
by O
the O
number O
of O
cars O
and O
size O
of O
houses O
, O
if O
nothing O
else O
. O

Many O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
have O
stayed B-NONMOTION_EVENT
with O
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
this O
trip B-PATH
, O
especially O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
countryside B-PLACE
, O
live B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
small O
houses B-PLACE
, O
are O
poor O
, O
own O
no O
car O
, O
and O
have O
little O
healthcare O
. O

While O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
would O
laugh O
and O
share O
food O
with O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
many B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
want O
what O
we O
have O
, O
and O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
would O
tell O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
so O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
am O
left O
with O
a O
desire O
to O
help O
these O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
but O
also O
a O
sad O
feeling O
that O
we O
cannot O
all O
be O
rich O
â O
€ O
“ O
under O
our O
current O
system O
, O
being O
rich O
simply O
uses O
too O
many O
fossil O
fuels O
. O

If O
we O
want O
the O
world O
to O
be O
wealthy O
, O
we O
must O
first O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
be O
rich O
and O
not O
produce O
so O
many O
greenhouse O
gasses O
. O

That O
is O
our O
challenge O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
ask O
you O
all O
now O
to O
turn O
your O
eyes O
to O

that O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
deeply O
believe O
in O
, O
as O
it O
is O
clear O
that O

Cartagena O
and O
the O
Colombian O
Presidential O
Elections O
Sunday O
, O
May O
28th O
, O
2006 O
When O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
arrived B-MOTION
in O
Cartagena B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked O
to O
a O
few O
local O
contacts O
about O
how O
to O
bike O
Colombia B-PLACE
safely O
. O

All O
recommended O
that O
it O
would O
be O
safest O
to O
travel O
after O
the O
presidential O
elections O
, O
which O
were O
to O
be O
held O
that O
Sunday O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
found O
a O
5 O
dollar O
hotel O
, O
and O
spent B-NONMOTION_EVENT
a O
few O
days O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
town B-PLACE
. O

Cartagena B-PLACE
is O
one O
of O
the O
oldest O
European O
cities B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
South B-PLACE
America I-PLACE
, O
founded O
in O
the O
1530s O
. O

The O
historic O
downtown B-PLACE
is O
surrounded B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
by O
city O
walls B-PATH
to O
keep O
out O
Caribbean O
pirates O
( O
the O
city B-PLACE
was O
sacked O
numerous O
times O
) O
, O
and O
the O
streets B-PATH
are O
barely O
wide O
enough O
for O
two O
horse O
carriages O
. O

The O
city B-PLACE
sits B-NONMOTION_EVENT
barely O
above B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
sea O
level B-PATH
, O
and O
, O
like O
the O
islands O
of O
the O
Kuna O
Indians O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
wondered O
what O
the O
future O
of O
the O
city B-PLACE
will O
be O
when O
the O
ocean O
level B-PATH
rises B-MOTION
. O

On O
election O
day O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
walked B-MOTION
around O
the O
downtown B-PLACE
and O
watched O
Colombians O
cast O
their O
ballots O
. O

The O
ballots O
were O
simple O
â O
€ O
“ O
a O
single O
piece O
of O
paper O
with O
pictures O
of O
each O
candidate O
. O

Mark O
an O
X O
over O
your O
candidate O
, O
fold O
the O
paper O
, O
and O
put O
it O
in O
a O
box O
( O
ballot O
shown O
in O
the O
middle O
below O
) O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked O
to O
some O
of O
the O
election O
officials O
, O
who O
let O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
take O
pictures O
of O
the O
process O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
found O
that O
people O
were O
willing O
to O
say O
who O
they O
voted O
for O
, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
conducted O
an O
informal O
exit O
poll O
. O

Of O
the O
20 O
or O
so O
people O
that O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked O
to O
, O
about O
5 O
did O
nâ€™t O
vote O
, O
10 O
voted O
for O
the O
current O
president O
, O
Alvaro O
Uribe O
, O
4 O
voted O
for O
Carlos O
Garivia O
, O
and O
1 O
for O
Horacio O
Serpa O
( O
because O
â€˜all O
of O
the O
candidates O
are O
corrupt O
, O
and O
he O
is O
the O
least O
corruptâ€™ O
) O
. O

The O
news O
that O
night O
confirmed O
my O
exit O
poll O
â O
€ O
“ O
Uribe O
won O
over O
60 O
% O
of O
the O
vote O
. O

Presidents O
are O
not O
usually O
allowed O
to O
run O
for O
two O
terms O
, O
but O
Uribe O
had O
the O
constitution O
changed O
so O
that O
he O
could O
run O
again O
. O

His O
popularity O
is O
due O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
security O
– O
according O
to O
every O
Colombian O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talk O
to O
, O
the O
country B-PLACE
is O
far O
safer O
now O
than O
five O
years O
ago O
. O

The O
army B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
has O
increased O
in O
size O
by O
over O
30 O
% O
, O
and O
all O
major O
roads B-PATH
are O
heavily O
patrolled B-MOTION
. O

A O
school O
master O
that O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked O
to O
remarked O
that O
â€˜a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
my O
friends B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
would O
fly B-MOTION
to O
Bogota B-PLACE
instead O
of O
drive B-MOTION

“ O
now O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
drive B-MOTION

the O
country.â€™ B-PLACE
My O
first O
night O
out O
of O
Cartagena B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stayed B-NONMOTION_EVENT
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
farm B-PLACE
with O
a O
man O
who O
had O
been O
kidnapped O
and O
held O
ransom O
for O
three O
days O
in O
2000 O
. O

He O
said O
â€˜thanks O
to O
godâ€™ O
after O
saying O
that O
Uribe O
won O
, O
and O
then O
he O
told O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
that O
it O
would O
be O
safe O
for O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
bike B-MOTION
the O
main O

which O
meant O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
got O
to O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

These O

Everyone O
along O

they O
almost O
all O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
learned O
a O
few O
useful O
phrases O
in O

( O
â€˜I O

27 O

â€˜I O

these O
extremely O
useful O
in O
making B-NONMOTION_EVENT
friends O
along B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL

road B-PATH

Biking B-MOTION
by O
one O

to O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked O
to O
them O
about O
my O
project O

The O
biggest O
environmental O
problems O
here O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
think O
, O
are O
deforestation O

Click O

The O
most O

in O

day O
here O
is O
about O
10 O
soles O
, O
or O
3 O
dollars O
, O
with O
many O
making O
far O
less O
. O

Some O
people O
beg O
for O
money O
, O
and O
people O
always O
ask O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
about O
money O
â O
€ O
“ O
how O

how O

these O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
never O
tell O

how O

my O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
now O
reply O
with O
â€˜how O
much O

your O
best O

) O
, O
but O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
be O
fully O
comfortable O
knowing O
that O
my O

cost O
far O
more O
than O
it O

Everyone O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

to O

, O
one O
man O
whose O
house B-PLACE
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
camped B-NONMOTION_EVENT
next B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL

explained O
that O
there O
are O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

“ O
people O

In B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
one O
town B-PLACE
, O
some O
kids B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
came B-MOTION
out O

pushed B-NONMOTION_EVENT
my O

from O

, O
helping B-MOTION
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
up O
a O
hill B-PATH

They B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
begged O
for O
money O
, O
and O
I O
gave O
them B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
some O
bread O
. O

They B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
pushed O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
some O
more O
and O
then O
one O
of O
them B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
opened O
up O
the O
rear O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
yelled O

quickly O

the O

The O
locals O
heard O

soon O
the O

crowded B-MOTION
around O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

and O
we O
had O
a O
friendly O

awkward O
conversation O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
got O
my O
tent O
stakes O
back O
, O
but O
somehow O
did O
nâ€™t O
feel O
good O
about O
it O

The O
majority O
my O
interactions O
, O
however O
, O
were O
like O
those O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
with O
Edgar O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
asked O
Edgar O
where O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
could O
buy O
matches O

He O
responded O
by O
giving O
me O
some O
matches O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
gave O
him O
my O
business O
card O
. O

He O
gave O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
some O
oranges O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
gave O
him O
some O
cookies O
and O
showed O
him O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
could O
count O

in O

He O
invited O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in O
for O
lunch O
, O
and O
you O
can O
see O
him O
on O
the O
left O
in O
his O
kitchen O

And O
then O
there O
were O
the O
3 O
different O
families O
whose O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
camped B-NONMOTION_EVENT
next B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL

all O
invited O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
fed B-NONMOTION_EVENT
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
their O

After O

According O

a O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stayed B-NONMOTION_EVENT

The O
most O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stayed B-NONMOTION_EVENT
an O
extra O

in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Zacatecas B-PLACE

talked O
with O
a O

Gregg B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

riding B-MOTION

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
met B-MOTION
Gregg B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

Brooks B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
back O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
San B-PLACE
Diego I-PLACE
, O
only O
to O
split B-MOTION
ways O
when O
my O
passport O
was O
stolen O
. O

No O
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
are O
not O
racing B-MOTION
, O
as O
the O
movie O
on O
the O
right O
suggests….(I O
say O
this O
only O
because O
it O
looks O
like O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
will O
beat O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
) O
. O

It O
is O
a O
different O
experience O
riding B-MOTION
with O
other O
cyclists B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

The O
bicycling O
is O
more O
enjoyable O
, O
and O
hotels O
, O
when O
split O
three O
ways O
, O
sometimes O
fall O
within O
my O
acceptable O
limit O
of O
$ O
5 O
a O
night O
. O

Yet O
interaction O
with O
local O
peoples O
is O
far O
less O
, O
as O
a O
group O
of O
gringos O
is O
more O
intimidating O
than O
an O
individual O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
hope O
to O
ride B-MOTION
more O
with O
Gregg B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
Brooks B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in O
the O
future O
, O
and O
there O
are O
a O

that O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
hope O
will O
join B-MOTION
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
on O
this O

But O
it O
is O
also O
clear O
that O
there O
are O
great O
benefits O
to O
being B-NONMOTION_EVENT

2005 O
After O
talking O
with O
Mr. O
Ransom O
â€™s O
9th O
grade O
class O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
decided O
to O
bike B-MOTION
through O
Los B-PLACE
Angles I-PLACE
to O
get O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
city B-PLACE
. O

Following O
a O
city O
map O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
rode B-MOTION
30 O
miles O
to O
Hollywood B-PLACE
and O
back O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
hoped O
to O
talk O
with O
cyclists B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
see O
how O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
managed O
to O
bike B-MOTION
in O
LA. B-PLACE
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
found O
only O
two B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

One B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
lost O
his O
license O
, O
and O
was O
forced O
to O
bike B-MOTION
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
asked O
if O
he B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
trouble O
with O
the O
cars O
. O

He B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
replied O
, O
â€œRecently O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
hit B-MOTION
by O
a O
Mercedes B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
then O
my O
arm B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
run B-MOTION
over O
by O
a O
Lexus.â€ B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
The O
man B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
then O
listed O
his O
hospital O
bills O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
biked B-MOTION
on O
the O
sidewalk B-PATH
( O
slowly O
) O
afterwards O
. O

The O
climate B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
L.A. B-PLACE
is O
perfect O
for O
year O
round O
bicycle O
commuting B-NONMOTION_EVENT
, O
yet O
few O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
bike B-MOTION
because O
1 O
) O
everything O
is O
so O
spread O
out O
and O
2 O
) O
there O
are O
few O
( O
if O
any O
) O
bikeways O
or O
bike O
lanes O
. O

The O
public O
transit O
does O
work O
, O
but O
only O
a O
few O
people O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked O
with O
seemed O
satisfied O
with O
it O
. O

Most O
trips B-NONMOTION_EVENT
are O
in O
a O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
and O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
traffic B-NONMOTION_EVENT
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
cars B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
are O
an O
inefficient O
way O
to O
travel B-MOTION
around O
a O
city B-PLACE
. O

A O
person O
in O
a O
car O
emits O
, O
on O
average O
, O
twice O
as O
much O
carbon O
dioxide O
as O
a O
person O
in O
public O
transit O
. O

Also O
, O
by O
comparison O
, O
cycling O
adds O
almost O
no O
carbon O
dioxide O
to O
the O
atmosphere O
( O
see O
comment O
on O
this O
) O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
would O
love O
to O
see O
an O
L.A. B-PLACE
with O
bike O
lanes O
and O
great O
public O
transit O
. O

It O
would O
require O
great O
change O
, O
but O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
think O
it O
is O
possible O
, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
think O
the O
city B-PLACE
would O
be O
far O
better O
for O
it O
. O

Returning B-MOTION
to O
Honduras B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
spent B-NONMOTION_EVENT
my O
first O
night O
camped O
outside B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
of O
a O
family O
’s O
house B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
countryside B-PLACE
. O

Like O
the O
last O
Honduran O
family O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stayed O
with O
, O
they O
had O
no O
electricity O
, O
although O
they O
did O
have O
many O
candles O
and O
they O
ran O
a O
small O
store O
selling O
refreshments O
. O

They O
invited O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
into O
their O
home O
, O
let O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
cook B-NONMOTION_EVENT
my O
dinner O
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
their O
stove B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
and O
showed O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
pictures O
of O
past O
family O
events O
. O

Earlier O
that O
day O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
drank O
some O
water O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
should O
not O
have O
. O

That O
night O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
emerged B-MOTION
from O
my O
tent B-PLACE
many O
times O
, O
and O
one O
time O
left O
a O
pile B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
vomit O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
lawn B-PLACE
near O
the O
outhouse B-PLACE
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
way O
to O
be O
a O
good O
guest O
. O

Although O
a O
dog O
and O
the O
rain O
immediately O
cleaned O
up O
my O
mess O
, O
the O
family O
had O
heard O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
because O
, O
as O
they O
told O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in O
the O
morning O
, O
they O
could O
not O
sleep O
because O
of O
mosquitoes O
at O
night O
. O

They O
said O
they O
could O
not O
afford O
a O
mosquito O
net O
. O

The O
mother O
gave O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
some O
medicine O
and O
wished O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
well O
; O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
felt O
bad O
that O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
little O
to O
give O
in O
return O
, O
but O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
shared O
some O
of O
my O
food O
and O
offered O
to O
mail O
them O
a O
copy O
of O
a O
picture O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
took O
of O
them O
. O

After O
spending O
a O
day O
recovering B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
hotel B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
city B-PLACE
of O
La B-PLACE
Paz I-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
biked B-MOTION
into O
Tegucigalpa B-PLACE
, O
Honduras O
’ O
capital O
city O
. O

The O
city B-PLACE
sits B-NONMOTION_EVENT
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
about O
3,000 O
feet O
above O
sea B-PLACE
level I-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
middle B-PLACE
of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
large O
valley B-PATH
surrounded B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL

Here B-PLACE
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stayed B-NONMOTION_EVENT
with O
Marta B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
Carleton B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
the O
mother O
and O
step-father O
of O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
from O
college O
. O

Carleton B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
runs O
a O
school O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
week O
before O
Easter O
, O
and O
all O
of O
Latin B-PLACE
America I-PLACE
is O
on O
vacation O
( O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O
, O
however O
, O
get O
an O
interview O
on O
television O
) O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
Carleton B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
gave O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
a O
tour B-MOTION
of O
the O
city B-PLACE
and O
told O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
about O
how O
he B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
once O
ran O
for O
mayor O
of O
Tegucigalpa B-PLACE
. O

He B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
ran O
on O
an O
anti-corruption O
platform O
, O
but O
then O
lost O
the O
race O
to O
a O
man O
who O
, O
as O
was O
later O
learned O
, O
received O
illegal O
funding O
from O
the O
government O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
continued B-MOTION
into O
Nicaragua B-PLACE
, O
which O
did O
not O
change O
dramatically O
from O
Honduras B-PLACE
. O

Nicaragua B-PLACE
is O
one B-PLACE
of O
the O
poorer O
countries B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Latin B-PLACE
America I-PLACE
( O
see O
comparison O
) O
. O

Like O
El B-PLACE
Salvador I-PLACE
, O
Nicaragua B-PLACE
had O
a O
long O
civil O
war O
during O
the O
1980s O
. O

However O
, O
in O
Nicaragua B-PLACE
, O
it O
was O
the O
government O
that O
was O
socialist O
instead O
of O
the O
guerillas O
attempting O
to O
overthrow O
it O
. O

As O
such O
, O
the O
U.S. B-PLACE
massively O
supported O
the O
guerrillas O
, O
and O
also O
enacted O
a O
trade O
embargo O
that O
strangled O
the O
country B-PLACE
( O
the O
people O
fighting O
the O
government O
were O
known O
as O
‘ O
contras O
, O
’ O
and O
you O
may O
know O
of O
this O
from O
the O
‘ O
Iran-contra O
’ O
affair O
) O
. O

Now O
the O
country B-PLACE
is O
peaceful O
, O
and O
, O
like O
El B-PLACE
Salvador I-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
felt O
relatively O
safe O
biking B-MOTION
. O

As O
it O
was O
the O
week O
before O
Easter O
, O
everyone O
was O
on O
vacation O
, O
and O
most O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
beach B-PATH
or O
the O
local O
swimming O
hole B-PLACE
. O

On O
Good O
Friday O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
passed B-MOTION
a O
family B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
that O
demanded O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
join B-MOTION
them B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
local O
pool B-PLACE
. O

Despite O
the O
strange O
murky O
color O
of O
the O
pool O
water O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
enjoyed O
playing O
tag O
and O
diving B-MOTION
into O
the O
crowded O
pool B-PLACE
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
high-speed O

, O
you O
should O
look O
at O
the O

the O
right O

Arriving B-MOTION

In O
an O

showed B-MOTION
up I-MOTION
at O
the O

with O
the O
most O
ridiculous O

could O

With O
over O
half O
a O

we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
quickly O
assembled O

attached O
the O

as O
a O

biked B-MOTION

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

a O

turned O
out O
to O
be O
only O
a O

Eager O
to O
get B-MOTION
in O
the O
mountains B-PLACE
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O
the O
only O
logical O
thing O
: O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
found O
a O
guide B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
disassembled O
my O
bicycle B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
rented O
a O
horse O
, O
and O
started O
walking B-MOTION

This O
trail B-PATH
was O
not O
through B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
wilderness B-PLACE
– O
along B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
sides B-PATH
were O
coffee O
plantations B-PLACE
, O
and O
every O
few O
hours O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
would O
pass B-MOTION
a O
small O
village B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
could O
buy B-NONMOTION_EVENT
food O
or O
camp B-NONMOTION_EVENT
for O
the O
night O
. O

The O
last O
town B-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stayed B-NONMOTION_EVENT

San B-PLACE

even O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
asked O

this O

if O
they O
had O
ever O

a O

almost O

This O
town B-PLACE
has O
not O
fully O
rebuilt O
from O
the O
storm O

Hurricanes O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
stronger O
on O
a O
warmer O
earth O
. O

A O
recent O
study O
( O
here O
is O
a O
description O
) O
showed O
how O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
power O
of O
Atlantic O
hurricanes O
over O
the O
past O
20 O
years O
is O
correlated O
with O
warmer O
ocean O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Atlantic B-PLACE
. O

This O
makes O
intuitive O
sense O
– O
hurricanes O
get O
their O
energy O
from O
warm O
ocean O
water O
, O
and O
warmer O
ocean O
water O
should O
mean O
more O
powerful O
hurricanes O
. O

More O
powerful O
hurricanes O
are O
also O
predicted O
by O
climate O
models O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
much O
of O
the O
damage O
done O
by O
hurricanes O
is O
not O
just O
by O
their O
winds O
, O
but O
by O
the O
rain O
that O
accompanies O
the O
storms O
. O

A O
warmer O
atmosphere O
can O
hold O
more O
water O
, O
and O
thus O
will O
likely O
provide O
heavier O
rains O

, O
the O

worse O
than O
any O

there O

men B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in O

with O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
found O
these O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
felt O
safe O
with O
them B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
later O
learned O
that O
although O
it O

generally O
safe O
to O

this O
area B-PLACE

it B-PLACE
is O
â€˜paramilitary O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

During O

Lima B-PLACE

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
crossed B-MOTION
the O
city B-PLACE
several O
times O
, O
logging O
150 O

on O
my O

With O
over O
9 O

, O
Lima B-PLACE
has O
no O
mass O

system O
, O
and O
only O
an O
inefficient O
system O
of O
busses O

Few O
Limans O
own O
cars O
, O
so O
most O
use O
the O
busses O
, O
which O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
found O
to O
be O
always O
slower O
than O
using O
my O

( O
see O

for O

So O
, O
do O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
bike B-MOTION
in O
Lima B-PLACE
? O

There B-PLACE
are O
a O
few O
bike O
lanes B-PATH

they B-PATH
are O
of O
low O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
got O
up O

€ O
“ O
for O
comparison O

these O

, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

( O
see O

. O

The O
city B-PLACE

flat O
, O
never O
rains B-NONMOTION_EVENT
, O
and O
has B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
cool O
comfortable O
climate B-NONMOTION_EVENT
â O
€ O
“ O
it B-PLACE
is O
a O
perfect O
place B-PLACE
for O
bicycle O
use B-MOTION
, O
yet O
the O
infrastructure B-NONMOTION_EVENT
to O
do O
so O
is O
poor O
. O

( O
At O
the O
office B-PLACE
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
people O
work B-NONMOTION_EVENT
on O
bike O
lanes O
, O
only O
one O
out O
of O
four O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
bikes B-MOTION
to O
work B-PLACE
. O
) O

In O
the O
next O
few O
decades O
, O
cities B-PLACE
like O
Lima B-PLACE
have O
a O
choice O
– O
support O
individual O
car O
use B-MOTION
, O
or O
support O
mass O
transit B-MOTION
and O
non-motorized O
transit B-MOTION
. O

If O
cities O
support O
car O
use O
, O
as O
the O
economy O
grows O
and O
more O
people O
can O
afford O
cars O
, O
their O
greenhouse O
gass O
emissions O
will O
grow O
rapidly O
, O
worsening O
global O
warming O
. O

If O
cities O
choose O
a O
less O
car O
intensive O
path O
, O
the O
city O
will O
not O
only O
produce O
less O
pollution O
but O
also O
probably O
be O
more O
livable O
. O

To O
develop O
sustainable O
transportation O
, O
a O
city O
needs O
not O
only O
good O
ideas O
and O
investment O
, O
it O
needs O
the O
people O
to O
support O
such O
projects O
. O

One O
problem O
, O
as O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
see O
it O
, O
is O
that O
many O
Latin O
Americans O
look O
to O
our O
cities B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
U.S. B-PLACE
as O
models O
for O
how O
to O
develop O
their O
spaces O
– O
the O
people O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
support O
projects O
that O
make O
their O
cities O
look O
like O
U.S. O
cities O
. O

And O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
will O
let O
you O
decide O
for O
yourself O
how O
to O
fix O
that O
problem O

to O
figure O
out O
just O
how O
big O
of O
a O
problem O
sea O
level B-PATH
rise B-MOTION
will O
be O
. O

The O
sea O
level B-PATH
has O
already O
risen B-MOTION
over O
the O
past O
century O
, O
although O
only O
about O
one O
inch O
. O

As O
more O
glacial O
ice O
melts O
, O
what O
will O
it B-PATH
do O
from O
here O
on O
? O

The O
most O
likely O
result O
is O
not O
that O
bad O
– O
maybe O
a O
foot O
and O
a O
half O
this O
century O
. O

This O
could O
be O
very O
bad O
for O
many O
places B-PLACE
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
have O
visited B-MOTION
â O
€ O
“ O
especially O
along B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Caribbean O
coastâ€”and B-PATH
also O
make O
storms O
much O
worse O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
erode B-MOTION
some O
nice O
beaches B-PATH
. O

But O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
might O
not O
call O
it O
a O
disaster O
. O

The O
problem O
, O
though O
, O
is O
that O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
for O
ice O
sheets B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
melt B-MOTION
, O
and O
we O
do O
nâ€™t O
really O
know O
how O
long O
that O
is O
. O

In O
the O
â€˜long O
run,â€™ O
which O
could O
be O
centuries O
or O
millennium O
, O
with O
a O
likely O
3 O
degree O
C O
warming O
, O
the O
ocean B-PLACE
could O
rise B-MOTION
80 O
feet O
. O

We O
do O
nâ€™t O
know O
if O
it O
is O
centuries O
or O
millennium O
, O
because O
computer O
models O
for O
ice O
sheets O
are O
very O
inaccurate O
. O

If O
it O
is O
centuries O
, O
as O
some O
argue O
, O
the O
oceans B-PLACE
could O
rise B-MOTION
much O
faster O
than O
we O
would O
like O
– O
maybe O
a O
foot O
a O
decade O
. O

And O
, O
again O
, O
we O
do O
nâ€™t O
know O
, O
but O
, O
well O
, O
do O
we O
want O
to O
find O
out O

a O

took B-MOTION
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

Andres B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

Hidden O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
fog B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
Andres B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
charged B-MOTION
ahead O
, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
followed B-MOTION
through O
a O
strange O
forest B-PLACE
of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
dwarf O
palm O
like O
plants B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
which O
can O
be O
100 O
years O
old O
even O
though O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stand O
only O
a O
few O
feet O
tall O
. O

According O
to O
Andresâ€™ O
GPS O
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
climbed B-MOTION
up O
to O
about O
12,500 O
feet O
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
temperatures B-NONMOTION_EVENT
were O
in O
the O
low O
40s O
. O

The O
region B-PLACE
is O
a O
national O
park B-PLACE
and O
protected O
because O
much O
of O
Bogota O
’s O
drinking O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
flows B-MOTION
out O
of O
these O
highlands B-PLACE
. O

The O
ground B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
rich O
in O
organic O
matter B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
and O
thus O
serves O
as O
a O
huge O
sponge B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
which O
stores O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
cleans O
it B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
and O
releases B-MOTION
it B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
slowly O
, O
so O
that O
even O
in O
drier O
months O
there O
is O
a O
steady O
flow B-MOTION
of O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
out O
of O
the O
park B-PLACE
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
sense O
of O
how O
sponge-like O
the O
ground B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
from O
the O
movies O
below O
center O
and O
left O
. O

On O
the O
right O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
am O
drinking O
water O
straight O
from O
the O
steam O
( O
it O
was O
really O
good O
water O
) O
. O

Over O
the O
past O
few O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
years O
, O
the O
earth O
has O
oscillated O
between O
cold O
spells O
, O
known O
as O
ice O
ages O
, O
and O
warm O
periods O
, O
such O
as O
we O
have O
today O
, O
known O
as O
interglacial O
periods O
. O

According O
to O
recent O
research O
, O
during O
the O
ice O
ages O
, O
the O
paramo O
grasslands B-PLACE
could O
be O
found O
further O
down B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
mountains B-PLACE
, O
covering B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
far O
larger O
area B-PLACE
. O

During O
warm O
periods O
, O
such O
as O
today O
, O
the O
paramo B-PLACE
is O
restricted B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
to O
the O
mountaintops B-PLACE
, O
literally O
islands B-PLACE
of O
grassland O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Andes B-PATH
. O

Climate O
change O
this O
century O
will O
likely O
push O
the O
planet O
far O
warmer O
than O
it O
has O
seen O
during O
these O
past O
glacial O
and O
interglacial O
cycles O
, O
and O
the O
paramo B-PLACE
will O
have O
to O
move B-MOTION
further O
up O
the O
mountainsides B-PATH
. O

But O
the O
ecosystem B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
already O
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
mountaintops B-PLACE
, O
with O
nowhere O
to O
go O
, O
and O
the O
region O
is O
at O
risk O
. O

A O
drastically O
warmer O
earth O
might O
remove O
the O
paramo O
ecosystem B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
removing O
not O
only O
the O
valuable O
water O
storage O
and O
filtering O
it O
provides O
for O
Bogota B-PLACE
, O
but O
also O
losing O
many O
unique O
species O
which O
are O
found O
only O
in O
this O
high O
Andean O
ecosystem B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

Before O
leaving B-MOTION
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
ran B-MOTION
into O
a O
group B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
park O
rangers O
who O
study O
small O
deer O
that O
live B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
park B-PLACE
. O

Andres B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
pulled O
out O
hot O
Colombian O
coffee B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
thermos B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
some O
sandwiches O
, O
wine O
, O
and O
chocolate O
, O
and O
we O
all O
enjoyed O
a O
picnic B-NONMOTION_EVENT
between B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
mountain O
lakes B-PLACE
. O

Not O
for O
the O
first O
time O
on O
this O
trip O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
wondered O
if O
future O
generations O
would O
be O
able O
to O
enjoy O
the O
same O
place B-PLACE
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL

2006 O
As O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
said O
in O
the O
last O

, O
Peru O

coast B-PATH
is O
home O
to O
one B-PLACE
of O
the O
driest O
deserts B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O

Despite O
the O
constant O
fog O
, O
it O
almost O
never O
rains O
â O
€ O
“ O
my O
tour O
guide O
for O
an O
exhibit B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Lima B-PLACE
told O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
that O
the O
last O
time O
there O
was O
heavy O
rain O
was O
35 O
years O
ago O
. O

All O
of O
the O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
for O
the O
city B-PLACE
comes B-MOTION
from O
the O
mountains B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
it B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
falls B-MOTION
as O
rain O
or O
snow O
and O
then O
melts B-NONMOTION_EVENT
, O
filling B-MOTION
the O
rivers B-PATH
. O

During O
the O
dry O
season O
, O
half O
of O
the O
year O
, O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
water O
is O
from O
melting O
snow O
and O
ice O
. O

Unfortuantely O
, O
almost O
all O
of O
these O
glaciers O
are O
going O
to O
melt O
and O
dissapear O
in O
the O
next O
50 O
years O
. O

It O
is O
unclear O
where O
Peruvians O
will O
get O
their O
water O
from O
when O
the O
glaciers O
are O
gone O
. O

The O
country O
â€™s O
energy O
supply O
is O
also O
at O
risk O
. O

According O
to O
people O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked O
to O
at O
PROCLIM O
, O
a O
project O
aimed O
at O
preparing O
Peru B-PLACE
for O
global O
warming O
, O
80 O

, O
during O
the O

season O
, O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
dams B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
from O
glacial O

. O

Unless O
investment O
for O

, O
Peru B-PLACE
might O

switch O

All O
of O
this O
will O
take O
