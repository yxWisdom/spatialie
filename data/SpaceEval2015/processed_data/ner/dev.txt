In O
a O
very O
friendly O
atmosphere O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
saw O
an O
affectionately O
restored O

building O
. O

Furthermore O
the O
trip O
lead B-MOTION
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
into O
the O
village B-PLACE
of O
Spindelwag B-PLACE
. O

Woodwork O
seems O
to O
play B-NONMOTION_EVENT
an O
important O
role O
here B-PLACE
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
I O
never O
saw O
more O

on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
heap B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
before O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
a O
big O
wooden O
hull B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
produced O
over B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
street B-PATH

After O
about O
1,000 O
meters O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
reached B-MOTION
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
court B-PLACE
from O
a O
homestead B-PLACE
. O

In O
these O
late O
hours O
I O
did O
n't O
wanted O
to O
disturb O
anybody O
, O
so O
I O
did O
my O
short O

dance O
without O
the O

Apart O
from O
the O

Despite O
the O

22-Mar-2008 O
-- O
On O
our O
easter O
holiday O
trip B-MOTION
to O
Munich B-PLACE
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
convinced O
the O
family B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
visit B-MOTION
this O
beautiful O
confluence B-PLACE
. O

After O
having O
left B-MOTION
the O
highway B-PATH
, O
it´s O
only O
a O
short O
trip B-MOTION
through O
Augsburg B-PLACE
and O
some O
smaller O
villages B-PLACE
to O
come B-MOTION
to O
this O
point B-PLACE
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
drove B-MOTION
some O
small O
roads B-PATH
along B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
nice O
Bavarian O
meadows B-PATH
and O
stopped B-MOTION
about O
500 O
m O
away B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
from I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
confluence B-PLACE
. O

From O
here B-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
a O
wonderful O
view O
on O
the O
Alps B-PATH
while O
dancing B-MOTION
towards O
the O
desired O
zeros B-PLACE
. O

After O
taking O
our O
pictures O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
continued O
our O
trip B-MOTION
to O
Munich B-PLACE
and O
the O
Bavarian B-PATH
Alps I-PATH
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
went O
skiing B-NONMOTION_EVENT
for O
one O
perfect O
day O
. O

26-Nov-2004 O
-- O
The O
initial O
plan O
was O
to O
meet B-MOTION
up I-MOTION
with O
my O
brother B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
sister B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
who O
were O
over O
from O
blighty O
visiting B-NONMOTION_EVENT
some O
relations O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Ingolstadt B-PLACE
that O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
n't O
seen O
in O
along O
time O
. O

Instead O
of O
rushing B-MOTION
there B-PLACE
, O
visiting B-MOTION
some O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
and O
rushing B-MOTION
back O
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
decided O
to O
leave B-MOTION
early O
and O
visit B-MOTION
CP B-PLACE
48N I-PLACE
12E I-PLACE
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
way B-PATH
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
left B-MOTION
Salzburg B-PLACE
at O
around O
11 O
a.m. O
driving B-MOTION
along O
the O
A8 B-PATH
( O
main O
Salzburg B-PATH
- I-PATH
Munich I-PATH
Autobahn I-PATH
) O
, O
via O
Rosenheim B-PLACE
to O
Aßling B-PLACE
and O
then O
towards O
Ebersberg B-PLACE
before O
turning B-MOTION
off O
down O
the O
road B-PATH
that O
took B-MOTION
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
the O
CP B-PLACE
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stopped B-MOTION
before B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
bridge B-PATH
over B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
stream B-PATH
. O

The O
CP B-PLACE
was O
located O
a O
few O
metres O
into B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
adjacent B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
field B-PLACE
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
hoped O
the O
ground O
would O
be O
frozen O
so O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
could O
walk B-MOTION
into O
the O
field B-PLACE
with O
my O
normal O
shoes O
, O
take O
the O
necessary O
photos O
, O
and O
clear B-MOTION
off O
. O

The O
weather O
had O
been O
quite O
cold O
a O
few O
days O
before O
but O
now O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
experiencing O
a O
warm O
period O
( O
6 O
degrees O
centigrade O
and O
beautiful O
sunshine O
) O
and O
the O
field B-PLACE
was O
muddy O
, O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

So O
it O
was O
on O
with O
my O
walking O
boots O
( O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
never O
a O
scout O
but O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
am O
always O
prepared O
- O
some O
of O
my O
friends O
would O
disagree O
) O
and O
into O
the O
field B-PLACE
. O

Luckily O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O
not O
have O
to O
do O
any O
dancing O
( O
have O
you O
ever O
danced B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
mud B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
? O
) O

as O
the O
zeroes O
came O
up O
immediately O
and O
stayed O
there O
. O

The O
differential O
GPS O
assisted O
accuracy O
showed O
2 O
metres O
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
took O
a O
short O
walk B-MOTION
to O
the O
infamous O
SPD B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
meridian I-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stone I-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
up O
to O
the O
bridge B-PATH
, O
took O
some O
more O
photos O
and O
decided O
to O
head B-MOTION
for O
Ingolstadt B-PLACE
. O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
behind O
schedule O
again O
but O
that O
did O
n't O
matter O
- O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
sunny O
day O
and O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
'd O
just O
successfully O
visited B-MOTION
a O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
. O

02-Aug-2005 O
-- O
Continues O
from O
48N O
26E O
. O

After O
an O
easy O
entry B-MOTION
to O
Romania B-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
visited B-MOTION
the O
church B-PLACE
of O
Pătrăuţi B-PLACE
. O

There B-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
met B-NONMOTION_EVENT
the O
priest O
, O
who O
was O
building O
a O
new O
wooden O
church O
to O
prevent O
the O
old O
one B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
from O
damage O
. O

He O
gave O
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
an O
very O
interesting O
guide O
of O
the O
church O
's O
history O
. O

It O
is O
painted O
outside B-PLACE
at O
one O
wall B-PATH
and O
also O
inside O
it O
is O
completely O
painted O
. O

Then O
passing B-MOTION
Suceava B-PLACE
and O
Botoşani B-PLACE
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
headed B-MOTION
to O
Săveni B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
took B-MOTION
road B-PATH
29 I-PATH
towards O
Manoleasa B-PLACE
. O

This O
road B-PATH
brought B-MOTION
us B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
a O
distance O
of O
410 O
m O
to O
48N B-PLACE
27E I-PLACE
, O
so O
it O
is O
not O
very O
difficult O
to O
find B-MOTION
the O
point B-PLACE
! O

We B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
parked B-MOTION
our O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
beside B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
hardly O
used O
street B-PATH
. O

Only O
some O
horse-drawn O
trolleys B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
with O
hay O
came B-MOTION
along O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

So O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
entered B-MOTION
a O
huge O
field-area B-PLACE
again O
and O
walked B-MOTION
around O
a O
corn-field B-PLACE
and O
through O
a O
sunflower-field B-PLACE
to O
a O
meadow B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
easily O
could O
locate B-MOTION
the O
CP B-PLACE
. O

Back O
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
headed B-MOTION
on O
to O
Iaşi B-PLACE
and O
on O
the O
way B-PATH
along B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
river B-PATH
Prut B-PATH
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
were O
able O
to O
see O
the O
country B-PLACE
Moldavia B-PLACE
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
other O
edge B-PATH
. O

12-May-2008 O
-- O
This B-PLACE
is O
the O
second B-PLACE
out O
of O
two O
confluence O
points B-PLACE
that O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
visited B-MOTION
on O
a O
bicycle O
trip B-MOTION
from O
Zurich B-PLACE
into O
the O
Vosges B-PATH
Mountains I-PATH
and O
the O
Black B-PATH
Forest I-PATH
. O

The O
story O
starts O
from O
48°N B-PLACE
7°E I-PLACE
. O

On O
confluence O
day O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
started O
cycling B-MOTION
at O
5:30 O
a.m. O
in O
the O
village B-PLACE
Midlach B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Vosges B-PATH
Mountains I-PATH
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
came B-MOTION
through O
the O
city B-PLACE
of O
Colmar B-PLACE
and O
entered B-MOTION
Germany B-PLACE
at O
the O
border O
town B-PLACE
Brisach B-PLACE
. O

At O
noon O
time O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
reached B-MOTION
Freiburg B-PLACE
– O
a O
city B-PLACE
that O
is O
located B-NONMOTION_EVENT
10 O
km O
west B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
of O
the O
confluence B-PLACE
. O

From O
Freiburg B-PLACE
, O
a O
nice O
bike-path B-PATH
along B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Dreisam B-PATH
creek I-PATH
leads B-MOTION
to O
the O
village B-PLACE
Stegen B-PLACE
( O
4 O
km O
from O
CP B-PLACE
) O
. O

From O
here B-PLACE
, O
a O
narrow O
valley B-PATH
of O
the O
Eschbach B-PATH
stream I-PATH
follows B-MOTION
upwards O
to O
the O
confluence B-PLACE
. O

At B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
small O
village B-PLACE
called O
Obertal B-PLACE
( O
510 O
m O
from O
CP B-PLACE
) O
I O
left B-MOTION
the O
main O
road B-PATH
and O
searched B-MOTION
for O
some O
tracks B-PATH
that O
would O
lead B-MOTION
upwards O
to O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
. O

My O
approach B-MOTION
was O
quite O
complicated O
; O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
detoured B-MOTION
to O
the O
top B-PLACE
of O
the O
hill B-PLACE
to O
a O
place B-PLACE
with O
a O
wayside O
cross B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
some O
nice O
benches B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

From O
this O
viewpoint B-PLACE
( O
300m O
from O
CP B-PLACE
) O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
could O
see O
the O
highest O
peak B-PLACE
of O
the O
snow B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
covered B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Feldberg B-PLACE
( O
1494 O
m O
) O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
parked B-MOTION
my O
bicycle B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
continued B-MOTION
on O
foot O
by O
climbing B-MOTION
down O
a O
steep O
grade B-PATH
directly O
towards O
the O
confluence O
point B-PLACE
– O
passing B-MOTION
by O
some O
grazing O
cows B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

Straight O
away O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
could O
see O
the O
unique O
marker B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
the O
point B-PLACE
: O
a O
green O
sail B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
from O
a O
windsurfing O
board O
with O
the O
inscription O
“ O

” O
which O
means O
‘ O
On O
18th O
July O
2007 O
Here O
has O
been O
the O
fourth O
grade O
elementary O
school O
Stegen-Eschbach O
. O

Confluence-Point B-PLACE
’ O
. O

Even O
though O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
consider O
such O
markers O
as O
pollution O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
followed O
the O
slogan O
of O
the O
Confluence O
Project O
which O
says O
“ O
take O
nothing O
but O
pictures O
, O
leave O
nothing O
but O
footprints O
” O
. O

So O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
kept O
the O
sail B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
as O
it B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
. O

Getting O
a O
perfect O
zero O
reading O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
lengthy O
back O
and O
forth O
– O
which O
is O
normally O
the O
case O
at O
densely O
forested O
steep O
grades O
. O

With O
4 O
m O
accuracy O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
finally O
located B-MOTION
the O
confluence B-PLACE
about O
6 O
m O
west B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
of O
the O
sail B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
directly B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
at I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
track B-PATH
. O

When O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
took O
the O
picture O
of O
the O
GPS B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
the O
accuracy O
turned O
to O
5 O
m O
again O
. O

Let O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
here O
consider O
an O
interesting O
geographical O
feature O
: O
The O
Vosges B-PATH
Mountains I-PATH
and O
the O
Black B-PATH
Forest I-PATH
are O
two O
related O
mountain O
ranges B-PATH
with O
similar O
heights O
( O
1424 O
m O
and O
1494 O
m O
) O
. O

Both B-PATH
are O
aligned O
north-south O
, O
one B-PATH
is O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
France B-PLACE
and O
the O
other B-PATH
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Germany B-PLACE
. O

They B-PATH
are O
geological O
related O
and O
divided B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
from I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
each B-PATH
other O
by O
the O
Rhine B-PATH
Rift I-PATH
. O

The O
Upper B-PATH
Rhine I-PATH
River I-PATH
runs B-MOTION
in O
the O
middle B-PATH
of O
that O
valley B-PATH
which O
is O
also O
the O
country O
border B-PATH
. O

Interestingly O
, O
both O
mountain O
ranges B-PATH
have O
comparable O
confluences B-PLACE
: O
48°N B-PLACE
7°E I-PLACE
( O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
France B-PLACE
) O
and O
48°N B-PLACE
8°E I-PLACE
( O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Germany B-PLACE
) O
. O

Both B-PLACE
are O
located B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
upper O
valleys B-PATH
that O
open B-NONMOTION_EVENT
out O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Rhine B-PATH
Rift I-PATH
. O

Both B-PLACE
have O
similar O
heights O
( O
730 O
m O
and O
555 O
m O
) O
, O
both B-PLACE
are O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
mixed O
spruce O
and O
beech O
forest B-PLACE
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
steep O
grades B-PATH
. O

While O
visiting B-MOTION
both O
confluence O
points B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
noticed O
these O
striking O
similarities O
. O

Maybe O
40 O
Million O
years O
ago O
, O
before O
the O
rift B-PATH
had O
formed O
, O
they B-PLACE
had O
been O
together O
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
one O
location B-PLACE
. O

After O
documentation O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
went B-MOTION
back O
to O
Freiburg B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
took B-MOTION
a O
train O
back O
home B-PLACE
to O
Zurich B-PLACE

Unfortunately O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
had O
to O

did O
not O

The O
Andean O
Paramo O
– O
the O
future O
of O

mountaintops O
Monday O
, O
June O
19th O
, O
2006 O
Before O
biking B-MOTION
out O
of O
Bogota B-PLACE
, O
a O
young O
professor B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
from O
a O
local O
university O
took B-MOTION
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
into O
the O
mountains B-PLACE
that O
overlook B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
city B-PLACE
. O

Andres B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
drove B-MOTION
from O
8,500 O
feet O
at O
Bogota B-PLACE
to O
11,000 O
feet O
and O
the O
national B-PLACE
park I-PLACE
of I-PLACE
Chingaza I-PLACE
. O

At O
this O
elevation O
, O
the O
pine O
forests O
give O
way O
to O
wet O
grassland O
known O
as O
the O
Andean O
paramo O
. O

Hidden O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
fog B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
Andres B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
charged B-MOTION
ahead O
, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
followed B-MOTION
through O
a O
strange O
forest B-PLACE
of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
dwarf O
palm O
like O
plants B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
which O
can O
be O
100 O
years O
old O
even O
though O
they B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stand O
only O
a O
few O
feet O
tall O
. O

According O
to O
Andresâ€™ O
GPS O
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
climbed B-MOTION
up O
to O
about O
12,500 O
feet O
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
temperatures B-NONMOTION_EVENT
were O
in O
the O
low O
40s O
. O

The O
region B-PLACE
is O
a O
national O
park B-PLACE
and O
protected O
because O
much O
of O
Bogota O
’s O
drinking O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
flows B-MOTION
out O
of O
these O
highlands B-PLACE
. O

The O
ground B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
rich O
in O
organic O
matter B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
and O
thus O
serves O
as O
a O
huge O
sponge B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
which O
stores O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
cleans O
it B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
and O
releases B-MOTION
it B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
slowly O
, O
so O
that O
even O
in O
drier O
months O
there O
is O
a O
steady O
flow B-MOTION
of O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
out O
of O
the O
park B-PLACE
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
sense O
of O
how O
sponge-like O
the O
ground B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
from O
the O
movies O
below O
center O
and O
left O
. O

On O
the O
right O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
am O
drinking O
water O
straight O
from O
the O
steam O
( O
it O
was O
really O
good O
water O
) O
. O

Over O
the O
past O
few O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
years O
, O
the O
earth O
has O
oscillated O
between O
cold O
spells O
, O
known O
as O
ice O
ages O
, O
and O
warm O
periods O
, O
such O
as O
we O
have O
today O
, O
known O
as O
interglacial O
periods O
. O

According O
to O
recent O
research O
, O
during O
the O
ice O
ages O
, O
the O
paramo O
grasslands B-PLACE
could O
be O
found O
further O
down B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
mountains B-PLACE
, O
covering B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
far O
larger O
area B-PLACE
. O

During O
warm O
periods O
, O
such O
as O
today O
, O
the O
paramo B-PLACE
is O
restricted B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
to O
the O
mountaintops B-PLACE
, O
literally O
islands B-PLACE
of O
grassland O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Andes B-PATH
. O

Climate O
change O
this O
century O
will O
likely O
push O
the O
planet O
far O
warmer O
than O
it O
has O
seen O
during O
these O
past O
glacial O
and O
interglacial O
cycles O
, O
and O
the O
paramo B-PLACE
will O
have O
to O
move B-MOTION
further O
up O
the O
mountainsides B-PATH
. O

But O
the O
ecosystem B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
already O
at B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
mountaintops B-PLACE
, O
with O
nowhere O
to O
go O
, O
and O
the O
region O
is O
at O
risk O
. O

A O
drastically O
warmer O
earth O
might O
remove O
the O
paramo O
ecosystem B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
removing O
not O
only O
the O
valuable O
water O
storage O
and O
filtering O
it O
provides O
for O
Bogota B-PLACE
, O
but O
also O
losing O
many O
unique O
species O
which O
are O
found O
only O
in O
this O
high O
Andean O
ecosystem B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

Before O
leaving B-MOTION
, O
we B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
ran B-MOTION
into O
a O
group B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
park O
rangers O
who O
study O
small O
deer O
that O
live B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
park B-PLACE
. O

Andres B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
pulled O
out O
hot O
Colombian O
coffee B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
thermos B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
some O
sandwiches O
, O
wine O
, O
and O
chocolate O
, O
and O
we O
all O
enjoyed O
a O
picnic B-NONMOTION_EVENT
between B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
mountain O
lakes B-PLACE
. O

Not O
for O
the O
first O
time O
on O
this O
trip O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
wondered O
if O
future O
generations O
would O
be O
able O
to O
enjoy O
the O
same O
place B-PLACE
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
standing B-NONMOTION_EVENT
. O

Peru O
Monday O
, O
October O
16th O
, O
2006 O
As O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
said O
in O
the O
last O
entry O
, O
Peru O
’s O
coast B-PATH
is O
home O
to O
one B-PLACE
of O
the O
driest O
deserts B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
world B-PLACE
. O

Despite O
the O
constant O
fog O
, O
it O
almost O
never O
rains O
â O
€ O
“ O
my O
tour O
guide O
for O
an O
exhibit B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Lima B-PLACE
told O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
that O
the O
last O
time O
there O
was O
heavy O
rain O
was O
35 O
years O
ago O
. O

All O
of O
the O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
for O
the O
city B-PLACE
comes B-MOTION
from O
the O
mountains B-PLACE
, O
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
it B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
falls B-MOTION
as O
rain O
or O
snow O
and O
then O
melts B-NONMOTION_EVENT
, O
filling B-MOTION
the O
rivers B-PATH
. O

During O
the O
dry O
season O
, O
half O
of O
the O
year O
, O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
water O
is O
from O
melting O
snow O
and O
ice O
. O

Unfortuantely O
, O
almost O
all O
of O
these O
glaciers O
are O
going O
to O
melt O
and O
dissapear O
in O
the O
next O
50 O
years O
. O

It O
is O
unclear O
where O
Peruvians O
will O
get O
their O
water O
from O
when O
the O
glaciers O
are O
gone O
. O

The O
country O
â€™s O
energy O
supply O
is O
also O
at O
risk O
. O

According O
to O
people O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked O
to O
at O
PROCLIM O
, O
a O
project O
aimed O
at O
preparing O
Peru B-PLACE
for O
global O
warming O
, O
80 O
% O
of O
Peru O
â€™s O
electricity O
is O
hydroelectric O
, O
and O
, O
during O
the O
dry O
season O
, O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
dams B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
from O
glacial O
runoff O
. O

Unless O
investment O
for O
huge O
new O
dams O
is O
found O
, O
Peru B-PLACE
might O
have O
to O
switch O
to O
using O
fossil O
fuels O
to O
produce O
its O
electricity O
. O

All O
of O
this O
will O
take O
place O
in O
a O
country O
where O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
have O
already O
seen O
many O
water O
problems O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
towns B-PLACE

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
have O
been O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL

certain O
hours O
of O
the O

In B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
met B-MOTION

job O
it O
is O
to O
resolve O
water O
disputes O

â€˜It O
is O
a O
big O

here O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
have O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
each O

the O
water B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
goes B-MOTION
to O
a O
different O
house.â€™ B-PLACE
A O
farmer O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stayed B-NONMOTION_EVENT
with O
near O
the O
coast B-PATH
pointed O
to O
a O
number O
of O
his O
crops O
and O
said O
that O
they O
would O
be O
twice O
as O
high O
if O
not O
for O
a O

And O
every O

the O

the O

expect O
from O

( O

be O
fair O

this O
is O
also O
due O
to O

Loosing O
the O

will O
be O
a O
major O
loss O
for O
Peru B-PLACE

The O
only O
solution O
may O
be O
to O
build O

five O

do O

( O
see O
comparison O
of O
U.S. B-PLACE

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
first O
admit O
that O
my O

pollutes O
enourmaously O

to O
take O
action O

“ O
and O
for O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
also O
emphasize O
that O

am O
talking O
about O
a O
global O
problem O
which O
we O
all O
need O
to O
work O
together O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
then O
talk O

“ O
asking O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

At O
the O

, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

time O
to O
help O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
congegate O
verbs O
, O
and O
, O
when O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
interviewed O
by O
the O
local O
television O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
mostly O
understood O
the O
questions O
and O
gave O
responses O
that O
might O
have O
been O
understood O
. O

Continuing B-MOTION
south O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
followed B-MOTION
the O
only O
major O
road B-PATH
through O
this O
section B-PLACE
of O
the O
Amazon B-PLACE
. O

While O
most O
of O
this O
region B-PLACE
is O
pure O
jungle O
, O
and O
there O
are O
very O
few O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
towns B-PLACE
, O
about O
half O
the O
time O
the O
roadside O
is O
cleared O
for O
cattle O
grazing O
. O

The O
cleared O
land O
, O
however O
, O
did O
make O
it O
easier O
to O
see O
the O
many O
types O
of O
birds O
( O
The O
shot O
on O
the O
right O
shows O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
crossing B-MOTION
the O
equator B-PATH
) O
. O

Further B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
south I-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
, O
however O
, O
a O
75 O
mile O
stretch B-PATH
of O
road O
is O
indigenous O
land B-PLACE
, O
reserved O
for O
the O
native O
peoples O
, O
and O
this B-PLACE
is O
pure O
jungle O
. O

The O
natives O
do O
not O
like O
outsiders B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
their O
land B-PLACE
, O
and O
you B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
are O
only O
allowed O
to O
pass B-MOTION
this O
section B-PLACE
during O
the O
daytime O
, O
and O
you B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
stop B-MOTION
. O

In O
talking O
with O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
road B-PATH
( O
talking O
in O
Portuguese O
, O
where O
we O
had O
to O
say O
everything O
a O
few O
times O
) O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
amazed O
at O
how O
afraid O
everyone O
was O
of O
the O
Indian O
reservation O
and O
the O
jungle O
. O

Most O
said O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
pass B-MOTION
through O
this O
section B-PATH
of O
road O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
thought O
that O
this O
was O
just O
prejudice O
against O
the O
natives O
. O

Before O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
entered B-MOTION
the O
reserve B-PLACE
, O
one O
man O
told O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
would O
be O
‘ O
killed O
and O
eaten O
’ O
by O
the O
natives O
, O
and O
then O
he O
added O
something O
that O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O
n’t O
understand O
and O
acted O
out O
some O
type O
of O
animal O
with O
large O
claws O
attacking O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
ready O
to O
dismiss O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
, O
but O
then O
he O
said O
‘ O
and O
, O
this O
woman O
had O
her O
husband O
killed O
and O
eaten O
by O
the O
natives O
. O
’ O

The O
woman B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
walked B-MOTION
over O
and O
confirmed O
what O
the O
man O
had O
said O
. O

At O
this O
point O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
reconsidered O
traveling B-MOTION
slowly O
on O
a O
bike O
through O
the O
reserve B-PLACE
. O

At B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
reserveÂ´s O
entrance B-PLACE
, O
though O
, O
a O
police O
officer B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
changed O
my O
mind O
. O

He B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
told O
me B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
that O
such O
attacks B-NONMOTION_EVENT
were O
far O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
that O
they O
would O
never O
happen O
along B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
road B-PATH
in O
the O
daytime O
– O
the O
tribes O
would O
harm O
only O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
who O
enter B-MOTION
their O
reserve B-PLACE
where O
they O
are O
not O
supposed O
to O
. O

Ok O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
thought O
, O
and O
continued O
to O
bike B-MOTION
the O
75 O
miles O
, O
stopping O
only O
to O
pee O
and O
get O
more O
food O
out O
of O
my O
pannier O
( O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
ate O
while O
biking B-MOTION
) O
. O

The O
jungle O
here O
was O
thick O
and O
alive O
– O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
saw O
numerous O
monkeys B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
( O
scared O
a O
few O
crossing B-MOTION
the O
road B-PATH
) O
, O
a O
small O
deer O
like O
animal O
, O
and O
heard O
many O
sounds O
that O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O
not O
hear O
elsewhere O
along O
the O
road O
. O

On B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
exit B-PLACE
to B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
reserve B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stopped B-MOTION
at O
a O
building B-PLACE
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
some O
of O
the O
indigenous O
people O
were O
selling B-NONMOTION_EVENT
crarftwork O
. O

Both O
of O
us O
speaking O
Portuguese O
, O
which O
is O
neither O
of O
our O
first O
languages O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
learned O
that O
yes O
, O
these O
people O
still O
hunt O
with O
bow O
and O
arrows O
and O
no O
, O
they O
do O
not O
drink O
any O
coca-cola O
( O
they O
did O
look O
very O
healthy O
) O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
asked O
about O
bicycles B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
crossing B-MOTION
the O
reserve B-PLACE
, O
and O
the O
man O
said O
‘ O
it O
is O
allowed O
, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
like O
it O
. O
’ O

After O
two O
more O
days O
of O
travel B-MOTION
, O
mostly O
through O
rolling O
hills B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
arrived B-MOTION

at O
noon O
on O
Saturday O
, O
riding B-MOTION
east O
through O
hilly O
suburbs B-PLACE

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
took B-MOTION
inland O
roads B-PATH
to O
avoid B-MOTION
the O
busy O
highway B-PATH
along B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
coast B-PATH
near O
Tiajuana B-PLACE

As O
night O
came O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
camped B-NONMOTION_EVENT
off B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O

of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O

so O
that O

( O
see O

, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
felt O
just O
a O
little O
silly O
for O
waiting O
for O
a O
week O
to O
get O
my O
passport O
. O

Biking B-MOTION
through O
Tecate B-PLACE
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
noticed O
immediately O
that O
Mexicans O
use O
far O
less O

than O
Americans O
– O
every O
car B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

had O
at O

Biking B-MOTION
the O
dry O

fairly O
uninhabited O
valleys B-PLACE
before O
reaching B-MOTION
a O
valley B-PLACE
of O
vineyards B-PLACE
near O

As O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
asked O
local O

if O
there O
was O
a O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
could O
pitch B-MOTION
my O
tent B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

At B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O

They O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
gave O
them O
my O

which O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

Riding B-MOTION
a O

and O
a O
half O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
arrived B-MOTION
at O
the O
ruins B-PLACE
of I-PLACE
Tikal I-PLACE
, O
a O
city O
that O
was O
once O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
and O
most O
important O
cities O
of O
the O
ancient O
Maya O
. O

The O
Mayan O
civilization O
thrived O
from O
a O
few O
centuries O
before O
Christ O
until O
around O
900 O
AD O
, O
when O
the O
civilization O
collapsed O
, O
and O
nearly O
all O
cities B-PLACE
across B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
peninsula B-PATH
were O
abandoned O
. O

Now O
the O
impressive O
stone O
pyramids B-PLACE
and O

are O
covered B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
by O
jungle B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
tourists B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

The O
Tikal B-PLACE

sit B-NONMOTION_EVENT
near O
the O
large O
lake B-PLACE
of I-PLACE
Peten-Itza I-PLACE
, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
stayed B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
hotel B-PLACE
overlooking B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
this O
lake B-PLACE
for O
$ O
5 O
a O
night O
while O
nursing O
a O
small O
cold O

Here B-PLACE
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
met B-MOTION
with O
a O
group B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
researchers O
who O
are O
drilling B-NONMOTION_EVENT
into O
the O
lake O
’s O
bottom B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
attempting O
to O
determine O
the O
past O
climate O
of O
the O
region O
. O

By O
looking O
at O
the O
composition O
of O
layers O
of O
sediment B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
lake O
’s O
bottom B-PLACE
, O
the O
scientists O
can O
determine O
past O
rainfall O
patterns O
and O
temperature O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
type O
of O
vegetation B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
that O
surrounded B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
lake B-PLACE
. O

According O
to O
their O
research O
, O
around O
900AD O
, O
when O
the O
Mayan O
civilization O
collapsed O
, O
a O
series O
of O
intense O
droughts O
struck O
the O
region O
, O
likely O
making O
it O
difficult O
for O
the O
Mayans O
to O
feed O
their O
large O
cities O
. O

The O
lake O
sediments O
also O
suggest O
major O
deforestation O
of O
the O
region O
, O
and O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
a O
combination O
of O
drought O
and O
land O
degradation O
led O
the O
Mayans B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
abandon B-MOTION
their O
settlements B-PLACE
. O

We O
cannot O
be O
sure O
of O
how O
the O
Mayan O
civilization O
collapsed O
, O
but O
it O
now O
seems O
that O
climate O
change O
helped O
end O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
ancient O
civilizations O
of O
the O
new O

you O

why O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
chose O
to O
bike B-MOTION
to O
the O
capital B-PLACE

Colombia B-PLACE
. O

In O
the O
1990s O
, O
in O
the O
face O
of O
horrible O

congestion B-NONMOTION_EVENT
, O
Bogota B-PLACE
did O
something O
amazing O
â O
€ O
“ O
it O
reduced B-MOTION
space B-PLACE
for O
cars O
. O

The O
city O
removed O
lanes O
from O
a O
number O
of O
major O
thruways O
to O
make O
way O
for O
new O
high-speed O
busses O
, O
and O
sidewalks O
that O
were O
used O
for O
parking O
cars O
were O
replaced O
by O
pedestrian O

and O
bikeways O
. O

A O
large O
number O
of O
pedestrian O
bridges B-PATH
were O
built O
, O
allowing O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
easily O
pass B-MOTION
over O
the O
major O
roads B-PATH
of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
city B-PLACE
. O

In O
short O
, O
the O
city B-PLACE
was O
redesigned O
around O
people O
instead O
of O
around O
the O
automobile O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked O
with O
a O
number O
of O
locals O
about O
how O
the O
city B-PLACE
had O
changed O
. O

Some O
cited O
statistics O
– O
whereas O
traveling O
across O
the O
city B-PLACE
used O
to O
take O
a O
few O
hours O
, O
the O
new O
bus O
system O
, O
named O
the O
â€˜transmilenioâ€™ O
will O
take O
perhaps O
45 O
minutes O
. O

Safety O
has O
improved O
as O
well O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
traffic O
accidents O
reduce O

, O
but O
violent O
crime O
also O
nearly O
halved O
( O
here O

an O

about O

Most O
people O
, O
though O
, O
remarked O
that O
Bogota B-PLACE
is O
simply O
a O
nicer O
place B-PLACE
to O
live B-NONMOTION_EVENT

respect O

The O

and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
spent O
much O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY

the O
southern O
( O
poorer O

gave O
presentations O
to O
groups O

who O
are O

Bogota B-PLACE
now O
has O
over O
300 O
km O
of O
dedicated O
bike O
routes B-PATH
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
city B-PLACE

and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
biked B-MOTION
at O
least O
half O
of O
them B-PATH
in O
my O
week B-NONMOTION_EVENT
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Bogota B-PLACE
. O

According O
to O
Ricardo O
, O
since O
the O
installation O
of O
the O
ciclorutas B-PATH
, O
bicycle O
use O
has O
increased O
5 O
times O
in O
the O
city B-PLACE
, O
and O
now O
there O
are O
probably O
between O
300,000 O

400,000 O
trips B-MOTION
made O
daily O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Bogota B-PLACE

A O
large O

this O

in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
southern O
, O
poorer O
region B-PLACE
of B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
town B-PLACE
, O
and O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
joined B-MOTION
Ricardo B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
a O
few O
other O
members B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
Ciudad O
Humana O
one O
morning O
to O
bike B-MOTION
across O
the O
city B-PLACE
and O
see O
the O
rush O
hour O
bike O
traffic B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
the O
ciclorutas B-PATH
are O
not O
perfect O
. O

There O
are O
many O
places B-PLACE
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
city B-PLACE
where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
they B-PATH
do O
not O
connect B-MOTION
, O
and O
you O
may O
find O
yourself O
in O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
man O
shown O
in O
the O
photo O
on O
the O
right O
. O

Also O
, O
they B-PATH
are O
placed O
on B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
sidewalk B-PATH
in O
such O
a O
way O
so O
as O
to O
put O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
in O
competition O
( O
you O
can O
watch O
the O
video O
on O
the O
right O
to O
understand O
this O
) O
. O

But O
the O
ciclorutas B-PATH
are O
nonetheless O
incredibly O
successful O
, O
showing O
that O
with O
more O
investment O
, O
even O
more O
is O
possible O
. O

I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
spent B-NONMOTION_EVENT
my O
last O
day O
in B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
city B-PLACE
enjoying O
the O
ciclovia O
, O
an O
event O
every O
Sunday O
where O
many O
roads O
are O
closed O
to O
cars O
and O
open O
only O
for O
bicycles O
. O

Apparently O
, O
I B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
saw O
it O
on O
a O
low O
turnout O
day O
( O
blame O
the O
world O
cup O
– O
Brazil B-PLACE
was O
playing O
) O
, O
but O
the O
roads B-PATH
were O
still O
filled B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
with O
bicycles B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
out O
to O
enjoy O
themselves O
. O

( O
The O
clowns O
on O
the O
right O
are O
in O
charge O
of O
making O
fun O
of O
people O
without O
helmets O
. O
) O

The O
new O
Bogota B-PLACE
has O
another O
benefit O
as O
well O
â O
€ O
“ O
people B-SPATIAL_ENTITY
are O
traveling B-MOTION
more O
efficiently O
, O
using O
fewer O
fossil O
fuels O
. O

Indeed O
, O
redesigning O
Bogota B-PLACE
around O
people O
and O
bicycles O
has O
not O
only O
improved O
the O
safety O
, O
health O
, O
and O
pride O
of O
its O
citizens O
, O
but O
the O
city O
has O
also O
reduced O
its O
effect O
on O
the O
global O
environment O
. O

This O
is O
a O
win-win O
situation O
â O
€ O
“ O
better O
city O
living O
and O
less O
carbon O
dioxide O
emissions O
. O

Hopefully O
, O
more O
cities O
in O
the O
world O
can O
follow O
Bogota O

example O

there O

is O
the O
possible O
spread O
of O
tropical O
diseases O

In B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
Colombia B-PLACE

the O

where B-SPATIAL_SIGNAL
it O
is O
too O
cold B-NONMOTION_EVENT
for O
many O
tropical O

such O
as O
malaria O

As O
the O

more O
